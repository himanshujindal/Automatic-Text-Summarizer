     "There was no panic," said passenger Tom Vento, 56, of Philadelphia. "I was
surprised that with so many people everyone was so calm.;    "At first, we
thought it was a joke, but then we saw that it was serious.";    The 14-deck,
800-foot luxury liner left Miami on Saturday for a seven-day voyage to La
Badee, a private island near Haiti; Puerto Rico; and St. Thomas in the U.S.
Virgin Islands.;    Rich Steck, a spokesman for Miami-based Royal Caribbean
Cruise Line, which owns the ship, said it would return to Miami on Wednesday
night after a Coast Guard safety inspection rather than continue the cruise.
Passengers will be given a full refund, he said.;    In Washington, the
National Transportation Safety Board said a two-member team would meet the
ship at Miami to investigate the fire.;    The board has been concerned about
the potential for accidents in the cruise ship industry and has held hearings
around the nation. Last year, it placed cruise ships on its "most wanted" list
of safety improvements.;    Steck said the fire, which started in a pantry
between the fifth and seventh decks, apparently was caused by an electrical
problem, but no details were available.;    The fire broke out about 1 a.m.
and spread to the 1,000-seat Follies Lounge, which was closed at the time. It
took about 4 1/2 hours to extinguish the blaze, the Coast Guard said.;    The
2,318 passengers and most of the 818 crew members were evacuated to a nearby
port terminal before they were allowed to return to the ship at daybreak,
Steck said.;    The 74,000-ton Sovereign of the Seas is one of the world's
heaviest cruise ships and the largest in terms of its passenger capacity of
2,521, Steck said.
