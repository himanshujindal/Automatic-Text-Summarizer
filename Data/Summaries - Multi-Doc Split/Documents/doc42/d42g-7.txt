     Russians vote Wednesday in the first democratic elections for the
presidency of the huge Russian Republic as well as for the mayors of Moscow,
Leningrad and other cities.;    In Moscow on Monday, an estimated 30,000
people marched through the streets in a show of support for Yeltsin, carrying
balloons and photos of their candidate and urging Russians to vote for him.
World chess champion Gary Kasparov spoke in Yeltsin's behalf.;    Just before
the first of the negative articles appeared, Yeltsin's aides privately charged
that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev personally had ordered a KGB smear
against Yeltsin. Though Yeltsin's staff would not repeat the allegations
publicly, the cycle of smear and recrimination indicated that the
rapprochement between Yeltsin and Gorbachev is little more than skin deep.;   
It also indicated growing desperation on the part of the Soviet leadership as
it watched Yeltsin build an apparently unassailable lead. If Yeltsin failed to
win an absolute majority, he would be forced into a runoff with his main
opponent, former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov. It is a matter of
debate whether Yeltsin will face a runoff.;    The Pravda article, purporting
to be a psychological study of Yeltsin by four academics, mentioned "a suicide
attempt at a time when his party career was finished." The assertion was used
to buttress a claim that Yeltsin was particularly unstable under stress.;   
"The main feature of Boris Nikolayevich's personality is his excessive need
for power," the professors wrote.;    Throughout his career, Yeltsin has shown
himself to be simplistic, disloyal and, above all, authoritarian, the
professors said, and his striving for power shows "an unconscious striving to
compensate for feelings of inadequacy.";    The suicide story was developed at
greater length in Sovietskaya Rossiya by former dissident Roy Medvedev, now a
conservative member of the Soviet Parliament. Medvedev supports Ryzhkov for
president.;    In a stinging attack on Yeltsin for hypocrisy and opportunism,
Medvedev declared that in late 1987 "Yeltsin even attempted to commit suicide
with a pair of sharp scissors used for cutting paper. This was a serious
nervous breakdown.";    Medvedev alleged that the incident took place soon
after a stormy meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee in October
1987.
