coleco industries inc., a once high-flying toy maker whose stock peaked at $65 a share in the early 1980s, filed a chapter 11 reorganization plan that provides just 1.125 cents a share for common stockholders. under the plan, unsecured creditors, who are owed about $430 million, would receive about $92 million, or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed. in addition, they will receive stock in the reorganized company, which will be named ranger industries inc. after these payments, about $225,000 will be available for the 20 million common shares outstanding. but coleco bounced back with the introduction of the cabbage patch dolls, whose sales hit $600 million in 1985. but as the craze died, coleco failed to come up with another winner and filed for bankruptcy-law protection in july 1988. the plan was filed jointly with unsecured creditors in federal bankruptcy court in new york and must be approved by the court.
