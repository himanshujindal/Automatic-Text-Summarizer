The administration believes it can garner 200-210 pro-Nafta votes, out of the 218 needed. The White House 'war room' believes the vote currently breaks down into 110 Republicans in favour, 65-75 Democrats in favour; and 20-30 leaning towards it.

State by state, undecided congressmen are being lured to the White House for intimate briefings, as are business leaders and journalists. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday gave his second impassioned speech on Nafta at an exhibit on the White House lawn of products likely to benefit from Nafta.
