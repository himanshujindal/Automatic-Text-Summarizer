But Gray said his models of air pressure, winds around the equator and winds for "El Nino" periods, when eastern Pacific waters are warmer than usual, do not allow for predictions of when or where a hurricane might form."It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average hurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season," Gray said in a paper presented to the conference.Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actually occurred.
