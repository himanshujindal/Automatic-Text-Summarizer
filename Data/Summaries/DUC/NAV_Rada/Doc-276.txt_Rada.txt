More likely, groups and interests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are seeking term limitations to improve their chances of winning office.Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls.For example, term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money on elections.Inexperienced legislators are less powerful in relation to legislative staff, executive branch bureaucrats and interest-group lobbyists from whom they must learn the customs and routines of legislative operations and the stories behind policy proposals.Veteran members -- proven vote-getters -- are much more powerful in relation to special interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain and expensive campaign environment.Why are we so certain that voters have such terrible judgment that they need a constitutional restriction keeping them from voting for incumbents they know and like?
