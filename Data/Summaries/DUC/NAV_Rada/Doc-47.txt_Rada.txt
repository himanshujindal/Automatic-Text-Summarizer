In 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths, down from the 59 killed a year earlier and well below the long-term average of 99 fatalities annually, the National Weather Service reported on Sunday.Meteorologists have attributed the decline in tornado deaths in recent years to increased public awareness of the storms, which are most common in May and June but can occur in any month of the year.Hot weather stirring the air helps form thunderstorms and their tornadoes, with 60 percent of all twisters occurring between noon and sunset, according to the National Center for Atmospheric Research.One of nature's most vicious spectacles, the tornado, is poised to renew its annual assault on America, as changeable spring weather breeds the storms that spawn twisters.When twisters are in an area, common sense and knowing a few simple rules can save lives, the National Weather Service says.The typical tornado is only about 50 yards wide and travels about two miles on the ground _ 87 percent of the time heading toward the northeast, NCAR researchers report.
