HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said.
