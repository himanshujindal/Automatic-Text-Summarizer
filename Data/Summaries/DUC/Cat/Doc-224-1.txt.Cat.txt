The Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by a London-based diamond cartel controlled by South Africa's giant De Beers diamond organization. De Beers' Central Selling Organization, which controls 80 percent of world diamond trading, has been based in London for 60 years. As well as selling the stones mined by De Beers and other South African companies, the organization trades on behalf of diamond producers including Zaire, Australia, Botswana and the Soviet Union. The Office of Fair Trading said it would first have to establish whether it had jurisdiction over the Central Selling Organization because although it is based in London, De Beers is a South African company.
