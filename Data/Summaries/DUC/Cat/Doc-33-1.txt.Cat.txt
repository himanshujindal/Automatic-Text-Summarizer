LOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates had been accused of nurturing one of the most brutal police forces in the country: now he is under attack for fuelling the violence and then standing by as it rolled across poor black neighbourhoods. That the Los Angeles police department should have been overwhelmed by the riots may be understandable, but it represents one final blot on Mr Gates's reputation. In March, Mr Gates strongly defended the detective who had led an investigation 17 years earlier into the killing of an off-duty Los Angeles police officer, although a judge had just released the two men wrongfully convicted, calling police conduct 'reprehensible' and urging an immediate investigation of the 'sordid record'. But the Los Angeles police chief has almost complete protection from removal under a 1937 statute that followed a series of political scandals, and Mr Gates has developed political clout on top of this job security. President George Bush last year called Mr Gates 'an exemplary police chief,' although at the time he called the conduct of the four Los Angeles officers -whose acquittal this week over the beating of a black motorist triggered this week's protests and violence - 'sickening' and 'outrageous'. A high-ranking commission appointed after the beating, under the chairmanship of Mr Warren Christopher, a lawyer and former deputy secretary of state, concluded that the Los Angeles police department got results, in terms of arrests, but had developed a 'siege mentality that alienates the officer from the community'.
