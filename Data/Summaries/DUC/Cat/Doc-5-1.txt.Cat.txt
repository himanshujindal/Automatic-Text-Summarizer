THE CONDITION known in cattle as 'mad cow disease', spongiform encephalopathies, has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelope population, the government has admitted. However, the government states in a footnote to the table that the reporting of scrapie in sheep has been encouraged since 1991 'to obtain material for spongiform encephalopathy research'. Mr David Maclean, junior agriculture minister, stressed that naturally occurring spongiform encephalopathies in species other than cattle were not notifiable diseases.
