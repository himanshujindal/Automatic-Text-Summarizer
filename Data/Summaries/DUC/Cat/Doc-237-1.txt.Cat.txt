THE Clinton administration will soon announce support for a North American Development Bank, which would fund projects in communities hit by job losses resulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Agreement by the administration is expected to bring Mr Torres and at least 7 other Hispanic congressmen into the pro-Nafta fold. The White House 'war room' believes the vote currently breaks down into 110 Republicans in favour, 65-75 Democrats in favour; and 20-30 leaning towards it. Under this hopeful scenario, the White House will use the last few days before the November 17 House vote to cajole, bargain and twist arms to get the remaining 8 votes. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday gave his second impassioned speech on Nafta at an exhibit on the White House lawn of products likely to benefit from Nafta.
