Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models to track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C. "All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models," said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellite service. The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston. Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane. To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane. "We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products," Pyke said, "and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path."
