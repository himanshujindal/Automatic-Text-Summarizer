A recommended halt to the government's "let it burn" forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the Western fire season next spring, according to the co-chairman of a panel that suggested the moratorium. The panel, in recommendations Thursday to the secretaries of agriculture and interior, said there were environmental benefits to allowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn. The panel suggested a temporary halt to the "let it burn" policy, saying the Forest Service and the National Park Service needed more time to refine their fire management plans. The panel was assembled last September after the worst fire season ever in drought-primed Yellowstone National Park. The report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are improved and strengthened. The agencies involved should make sure that fire management plans conform to departmental policies, that employees understand the policies, that everybody is using a common vocabulary and that agencies have agreed beforehand what to do if fires threaten to move across administrative boundaries, the report said.
