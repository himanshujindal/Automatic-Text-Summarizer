Mr Marko Kranjec, vice-governor of the Bank of Slovenia, or central bank, reckons Slovenes will have to wait years before they can obtain their foreign exchange savings.Of this amount, Slovenia accepts that its allocated share of that debt is Dollars 1.8bn.Before Slovenia declared independence, any foreign exchange deposits which Slovene citizens deposited in banks in Slovenia were transferred to the NBY.Officials at the the Ljubljanska Bank, Slovenia's largest bank into which the majority of the foreign exchange accounts were originally deposited, are hoping that the the government of Slovenia will guarantee these debts and open up negotiations with the NBY for the eventual return of the deposits.However, negotiating what share of the unallocated federal debt Slovenia should assume is already proving difficult.
