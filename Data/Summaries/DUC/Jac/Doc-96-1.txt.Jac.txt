Groups which have filed suit to ignore the aliens contend large concentrations of them could result in in some states gaining seats in the House of Representatives at the expense of other states. At stake are the 435 seats in the House, which are distributed among the states on the basis of population. "If both sides get their way, the only change would be a flip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia," said William O'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent Population Reference Bureau. The only change, he said, would be that California would gain five new seats instead of six, while Georgia would add two rather than just one. On the other hand New York would lose three seats.
