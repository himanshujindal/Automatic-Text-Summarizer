THE CONDITION known in cattle as 'mad cow disease', spongiform encephalopathies, has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelope population, the government has admitted. Mr David Maclean, junior agriculture minister, stressed that naturally occurring spongiform encephalopathies in species other than cattle were not notifiable diseases. He said there was 'insufficient epidemiological data' to 'draw firm conclusions' as to how the disease might have been contracted in cases other than scrapie.
