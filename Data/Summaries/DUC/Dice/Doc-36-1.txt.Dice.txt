Scientists missed by 150 years in dating the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, a clay tablet that also reflects fear among the ancient observers, researchers said today. Scientists had concluded about 20 years ago that the eclipse, recorded on a clay tablet found in Syria, occurred on May 3, 1375 B.C. But in today's issue of the British journal Nature, two Dutch scientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happened about 150 years later, on March 5, 1223 B.C. They concluded that the earlier text analysis of the tablet misidentified the time of year in which the eclipse occurred. In addition, the text apparently indicates that Mars was visible at the time of the eclipse, the Dutch researchers said.
