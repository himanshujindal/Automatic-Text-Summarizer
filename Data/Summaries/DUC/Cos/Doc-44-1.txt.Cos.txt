Cloudy weather Saturday threatened to mar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hoping to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun. The weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening, when the Finnish Meteorological Services predicted cloudy weather with a chance of showers for eastern Finland on Sunday. In the eastern town of Joensuu, a television news broadcast late Saturday showed it was already cloudy there with a light drizzle falling. In Helsinki, the total eclipse phase will occur 16 minutes after sunrise, when the sun is only 1 degree above the horizon. Ten months ago, Joensuu hired an "eclipse secretary" to handle arrangements for the expected influx of visitors. During the past week, newspapers, television and radio have been full of information about solar eclipses, as well as advice for spectators not to stare directly into the sun. The eclipse will be total in an arc about 125 miles wide from the northern Baltic Sea and southeast Finland, across the Kola Peninsula and northeast Soviet Union, to the Aleutian Islands near Alaska. Scientists will conduct several experiments during the eclipse, including gravity test measurements of the radius of the sun. However, scientific interest in this eclipse has been less than in longer eclipses, such as the seven-minute eclipse seen from northern Kenya on June 30, 1973.
