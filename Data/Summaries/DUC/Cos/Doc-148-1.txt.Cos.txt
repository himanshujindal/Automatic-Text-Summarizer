THE World Bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country's efforts to fight poverty, according to an operational directive to staff issued today by Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president. The link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make poverty alleviation the bank's central mission in the 1990s. The bank says poverty assessments should be available for most developing countries within two years. These would form the basis for a 'collaborative approach to poverty reduction by country officials and the bank'.
