President Reagan warned Saturday that he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him that does not contain a work requirement. "The best way to learn to work is to work," the president said in a Labor Day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20 miles north of here. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., in the Democrats' response, said that quiring welfare recipients work may be necessary, but he said such requirements should be controlled by state and local welfare officials, not the federal government. Reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of his administration's economic record, saying Friday's unemployment figures showed that the jobless rate "hovered just above the lowest it's been in 14 years." To deal with this, he said, his administration launched a program encouraging states to come up with their own plans to get people off the welfare rolls. "Nearly half of the states have implemented or proposed widespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good old common sense _ that the best way to learn to work is to work," the president said.
