Slovenia, whose 2 million inhabitants account for a fraction of Yugoslavia's total population of 23 million, is the most politically liberal and prosperous of the country's six member republics. Slovenia "should be set up as a sovereign state, with all attributes of factual authority and with full international-legal rights," Tanjug said, quoting from a declaration of the Slovenian presidency, the top local ruling body. The Slovenian move was endorsed by Slovenia's president, Milan Kucan, who told a Monday session of the presidency that the new constitution will be the "constitution of the sovereign state of Slovenia, and not of one of the federal (republics)," Tanjug said. Slovenia has been frequently accused by politicians and the media in Yugoslavia's more conservative southern republics, and particularly in the country's largest republic of Serbia, of harboring separatist tendencies and of protecting its own interests at the expense of federal goals.
