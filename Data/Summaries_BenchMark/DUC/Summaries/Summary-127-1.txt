Writers of "Letters to the Editor" of the Wall Street Journal,
responding to Michael Gartner's article "Tell Me a Good Reason for
Handguns," take the author to task for ignoring key facts.

One writer comments that 99.6 percent of handguns are not involved in
crimes.  Clearly, says the writer, it is not gun control but crime
control and further, that criminals ignore gun control laws.  Another
writer believes that Gartner is intent on removing handguns from
society.

A third writer suggests that Gartner distorts the Second Amendment
when he claims that it refers to the arming of a militia.
