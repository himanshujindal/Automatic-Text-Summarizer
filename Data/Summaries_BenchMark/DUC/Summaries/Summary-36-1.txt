Scientists report that a solar eclipse recorded on a Syrian clay
tablet as occurring on May 3, 1375 B.C. really happened about 150
years later on March 5, 1223 B.C.  The scientists compared the
criteria stated on the tablet, e.g., Mars visible, and the likely age
range of the tablet to a list of possible total solar eclipses visible
from Ugarit, where the tablet was found.  Only the later date fit the
bill.  Even so, it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a
total solar eclipse.  The next oldest is a Chinese record from the
Eight Century B.C.
