A white Long Beach police officer, Mark Dickey, who allegedly pushed a
black man, Don Jackson, through a plate-glass window during an arrest
has acknowledged to a Senate oversight committee that he made errors
in his official report.  Dickey admitted that it was he and not
Jackson who uttered obscenities during the arrest. Jackson testified
that in addition to pushing his face into the glass, Dickey hurt him
by bending his fingers while handcuffing him and pushing his face into
the hood of the police car. Officers refused to loosen his handcuffs
as he was taken to the station, Jackson said.
