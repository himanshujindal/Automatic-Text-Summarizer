With winds of 175 mph, Gilbert is the most intense hurricane ever
recorded in the western Hemisphere.  The barometric pressure at
Gilbert's center measured 26.13 inches, the lowest ever recorded in
the Western Hemisphere.  With storm force winds extending 250 miles
north and 200 miles south of the center, Gilbert was also one of the
largest.  Gilbert is only one of three Category 5 storms in the
hemisphere since detailed records have been kept.  Gilbert's storm
surge, the great dome of water that follows the eye and accounts of
90% of fatalities, is only 8-12 feet, less that Camille's which was 25
feet.
