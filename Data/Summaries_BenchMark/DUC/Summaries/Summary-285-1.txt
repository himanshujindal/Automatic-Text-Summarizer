Health Professionals and the Diabetes Society in California are
presenting a program to educate Hispanics in healthy food preparation
and diabetes prevention.  Food preparation, specifically frying of
foods in saturated fats, are believed to be one cause of the obesity
problem that often leads to diabetes.  Other factors stressed are
nutrition, spacing of food intake throughout the day, and exercise.
This is the first time education has centered on prevention of the
disease.

Educators in California and other heavily Hispanic areas are learning
that cultural factors are highly important in combating the alarming
rise of diabetes among this population.
