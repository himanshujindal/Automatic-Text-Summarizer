Sin City started receiving the first of 18,000 Southern Baptist this
weekend for their annual convention. Southern Baptist conventions have
drawn an average of 45,000 attendees in recent years.

Some members have decided to stay home this year not wanting to expose
their children to gambling, lack of pressing issues to discuss, and
not wanting to travel the distance from their stronghold in the
Southeast.

Those attending plan to distribute New Testaments and gospel tracts on
the strip.

Las Vegas officials are not in favor of this special attention, and
feel that life in Las Vegas outside the strip is little different from
any other city.
