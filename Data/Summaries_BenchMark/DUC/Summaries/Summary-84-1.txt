At a time when there is some hope for the control of the AIDS
epidemic, we are seeing a large increase in the incidence of
tuberculosis. In New York City tuberculosis declined from 1960 to
1977, but by 1990, it has increased to the 1960 level. Many of the new
cases occurred when individuals who had AIDS and lost the ability to
suppress the latent tuberculosis that they might have carried for
years. The rise in the tuberculosis actually began in the late 1970s,
probably because of the large increase in the number of homeless, a
group at great risk.
