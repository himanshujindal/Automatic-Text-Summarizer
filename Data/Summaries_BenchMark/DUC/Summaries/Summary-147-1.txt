Unlike many conventional systems for making loans in the world, making
a microloan to a Third World small business entrepreneur is almost a
guarantee of repayment. Recipients want the security of a favorable
credit rating. These microloans cancel out the need to get involved
with loan sharks.

Third world banks and large development organizations are making such
loans as well, particularly when they discovered that the repayment
rate by the poor is nearly 100 percent.

Some charitable organizations still prefer to make per-to-person
sponsorships and the teaching of skills to improve the quality of
life.
