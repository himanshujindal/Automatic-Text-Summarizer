Hurricane Chantal, the first of the season, caused an oil drilling
work vessel to capsize, trapping as many as 10 crew members.  Rescue
divers were unable to search the overturned vessel because of strong
winds and high waves.  The search had to be called off but it was
hoped that some of the crew were in airtight cabins with enough oxygen
to survive.  Chantal was expected to hit the western Louisiana or
upper Texas coast.  Coastal residents prepared for the storm and
grocery stores reported a steady demand for hurricane staples: bottled
water, batteries, canned goods and tape for windows.
