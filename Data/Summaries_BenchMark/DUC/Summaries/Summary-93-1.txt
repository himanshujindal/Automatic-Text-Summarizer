Some 40 members of Congress have joined with the Federation for
American Immigration Reform in announcing that a suit will be filed in
an effort to stop the Census Bureau from counting the estimated 2
million illegal aliens living in the United States.

Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., said everyone should be counted but the Census
Bureau should develop a method to determine how many people are
illegal and deduct that number from the figures used for
reapportioning Congress.
	
Rep. Jan Meyers, R-Kan., suggested that a question should be put on
the Census form asking whether respondents are U.S. citizens.
