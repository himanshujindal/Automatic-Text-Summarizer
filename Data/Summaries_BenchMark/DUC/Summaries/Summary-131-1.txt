A number of years ago, Ethiopian athletes came out of Africa and
surprised the world by winning three consecutive Olympic marathon gold
medals.  That domination appears to be happening again.

Now, Abebe Mekonnen, an Ethiopean policeman, has won the prestigious
Boston Marathon for 1989.  Two other Ethiopians were in the race,
finishing ninth and 18th.  In two days, runners from Ethiopia have won
three major world marathons.  Another Ethiopian is the favorite in the
upcoming London marathon.

Ethiopians train in a mountainous area of their country and it is this
altitude that enhances their performance.
