Heavy rains in California have worsened the threat of forest fires
this summer because they stimulate the growth of grasses which then
turn paper dry, helping to spread fires through trees and brush
weakened by five years of drought and by invasive insects.  The area
at risk is about a third of the US mainland, but the threat is most
extreme in California.  The severity of the threat and a lack of
equipment has prompted an aggressive program by authorities: putting
out the smallest wildfires before they spread, deploying firefighters
to where lightning storms are forecast, and clearing areas by setting
controlled fires.
