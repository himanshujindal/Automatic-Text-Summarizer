Henceforth, the World Bank will tie loan volume to efforts by a
receiving country to fight poverty.  This new emphasis will make the
aim of alleviation of poverty a central objective by the bank in the
1990's.

The Bank said that poverty assessments by country will be available
within two years.  The assessments will allow the receiving country
and the World Bank to collaborate in a joint effort at poverty
reduction.

The new directive rewards a government with larger loans for a
stronger commitment to poverty reduction; a weaker commitment to
poverty reduction will warrant less support.
