A major earthquake registering 7.1 on the Richter Scale struck off
Honshu early today. It was centered 60 miles off the coast and at a
depth of 20 miles. No casualties have been reported, but officials
fear a seismic tidal wave. Over the past few weeks a series of lesser
quakes have occurred in the same general area. Today's quake is the
strongest in the area sine March 1931, more than 58 years ago. A major
fault runs under Japan, and it is the reason for frequent quakes, but
most of them cause little damage.
