Lebanese security authorities, in coordination with Jordanian
authorities, unraveled the mystery of the assassination of Jordanian
diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut on 29 January 1994.  Apparently,
the Abu-Nidal group is not the only party responsible for the
operation.  An investigation revealed that the Fatah Revolutionary
Council (FRC) carried out the assassination in coordination with the
Jordanian fundamentalist Islamic Mobilization Youth Organization
(IMYO).  When IMYO was exposed, several terrorist groups moved to
neighboring Arab countries; namely, Jordan and Iran.  The
assassination was intended as revenge against the Muslim Brotherhood
Movement in Jordan, which did not agree with the extremism of other
fundamentalists.
