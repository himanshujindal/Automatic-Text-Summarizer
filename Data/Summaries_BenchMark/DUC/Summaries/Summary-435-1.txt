Much of Charles Keating's world was false and deceptive. The former
president of Lincoln Savings and Loan and chairman of American
Continental Corporation was unable to come to terms with the fact that
he drove many people to financial ruin.

After the verdict of guilty was read at his trial, he protested his
innocense and claimed that federal prosecutors drove him out of
business.

Keating's actions appear to be those of a man without a
conscience. His victims included many elderly investors who lost their
savings in the purchase of junk bonds. He described them as "insured
certificates of deposit."
