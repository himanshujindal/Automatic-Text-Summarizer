Maine's constitution previously guaranteed the right to keep and bear
arms "for the common defense."  The amendment then read: "Every
citizen has the right to keep and bear arms and this right shall never
be questioned."  With this change, even felons could bear arms.

In 1989, a judge dismissed a charge of gun possession by a felon;
prosecutors argued that the amendment did not intend for felons to own
guns.  The judge's ruling stated that there was no connection between
the felon's previous conviction and his ownership of a firearm.
