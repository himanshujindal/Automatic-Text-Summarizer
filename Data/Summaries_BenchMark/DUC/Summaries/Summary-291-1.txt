In terms of magnitude, Chile is the world's most seismic country.  It
has a coastline of 2,270 miles along the "ring of fire," between the
Nacza and South American plates.  A 1985, 7.1 Richter Scale earthquake
was comparable to the San Francisco quake.  But a 1960 quake of 9.5
destroyed Valparaiso.  Parts of the coast dropped nine feet and 5,000
people were killed. A tsunami followed, killing others.

Chilean engineers design their buildings of reinforced concrete.  They
do not rock during earthquakes, and since these codes were adopted in
1930, only three engineered buildings have collapsed.
