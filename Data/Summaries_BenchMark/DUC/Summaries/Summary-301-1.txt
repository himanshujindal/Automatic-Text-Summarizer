The MD82 Northwest Airline plane that crashed on takeoff August 16 in
Detroit had two previous incidents of engine failure, and was forced
to land in 1985 and 1986 following power loss in an engine.  Cause of
this crash has not been ascertained but engine failure seems likely.
154 were killed; a surviving child is in critical condition.  The
plane had a heavy fuel load and had ten more passengers on board than
its seat limit.

Engines of the type on the MD82 have had problems in the past and the
FBI is investigating reports of engine tampering.
