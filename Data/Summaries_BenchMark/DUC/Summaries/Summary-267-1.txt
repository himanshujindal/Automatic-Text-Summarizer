The strength and success of the Shining Path guerrillas remain a
question as Alberto Fujimori prepares to take over as Peru's president
on July 28.  The guerrillas began fighting cautiously in 1980, but
became lethal quickly.  The governments claims 20,000 have died and
damages of $16 billion.  Now 50% of the Peruvians live under emergency
law.  President Belaunde ignored the guerrillas, while President
Garcia, after first trying a liberal approach, became tough, then
eventually tried simply to coexist.  While Fujimori's campaign pitch
advocated economic-development initiatives, his actual policies may be
quite different.  The government claims to have captured a "safe
house" in Lima on June 4.
