House Minority Leader Michel said that the President would show no
flexibility on his position on the minimum wage.  Senator Kennedy,
whose Senate bill calls for a higher wage than the House, said that he
would offer an amendment to make his bill identical to that of the
House.  A new poll showed strong backing for the increased wage even

by 1992, if employers could hire new workers at a sub-minimum wage for
six months.  The House bill would raise the wage to $4.55
