The House Agriculture Committee has planned hearings for next year
examining how the U.S. Forest Service handled last summer's stubborn
wildfires that scorched the West.  The focus will be on firefighting
policies, rehabilitation of charred areas, and on scientific research
being done on the summer fires.  The U.S. Forest Service said 5
million acres were charred in the raging blazes, including 706,000
acres in Yellowstone.  The Forest and National Park Service spent a
combined $300 million fighting the fires.  Drought conditions, high
winds, and a "tremendous build-up" of tinder helped make the 1988
fires the worst in a hundred years.
