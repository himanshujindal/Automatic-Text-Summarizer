A lightning-sparked fire in Utah's Zion National Park spread out of
control to 1,000 acres Tuesday, but rain helped firefighters hold the
line on a 2,000-acre forest fire in Montana and two other major fires
in Wyoming.

A fire that scorched 1,130 acres in and around the Hiawatha Nation
Forest in Michigan was linked to a vehicle exhaust pipe.

Hundreds of small grass and brush fires were reported over the July 4
weekend, some caused by fireworks, in various parts of the country.

Kentucky's Division of Forestry reported 85 fires burned 1,267 acres
in the first four days of July.
