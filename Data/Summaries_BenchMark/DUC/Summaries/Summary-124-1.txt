The U.S. Congress has finally passed the Brady Bill after a long
struggle.  The bill requires a five-day waiting period before the
purchase of a handgun.  The Brady Bill, the recent ban on the purchase
of assault weapons, and other pending bills are being viewed by some
anti-gun proponents as an indication that the tide has turned in favor
of gun control.

Opponents of gun control, led by the National Rifle Association and
citing their authority as the Second Amendment to the Constitution,
continue their opposition to all forms of gun control.
