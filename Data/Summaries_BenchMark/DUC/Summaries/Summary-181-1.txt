William Gray, a hurricane expert, predicts more and fiercer storms in
the Atlantic.  He expects six this year, average for the last 40
years, but above average for the decade.  Gray said his models of air
pressure, winds around the equator, and winds for El Nino periods do
no allow for predictions of when or where hurricanes will occur.  He
predicted four in 1987, three actually occurred; four for four in
1986, seven for seven in 1985 five for seven in 1984.  Drought in West
Africa in the 1970s and 1980s robbed storm systems of moisture needed
to escalate storms into hurricanes.
