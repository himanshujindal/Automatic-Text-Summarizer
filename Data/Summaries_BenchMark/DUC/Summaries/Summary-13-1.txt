Hurricane Andrew made landfall late Tuesday night some 60 miles
southwest of New Orleans smashing its way through largely rural Cajun
country. The hurricane landed with winds of about 120 mph, causing
severe damage in small coastal centers, but sparing New Orleans. The
storm lost force as it moved north over land and by yesterday
afternoon was downgraded to a tropical storm with windspeeds less than
75 mph. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's oil refining
industry. A senior member of Lloyd's said yesterday insurers' losses
in Florida are likely to be less than $1 billion, well below earlier
predictions.
