White House Chief of Staff John Sununu has used five different
corporate jets to travel to Republican fund-raisers in the past six
weeks and the White House says he will continue to use such jets
rather than government planes for political travel. Meanwhile Sununu
created another, what President Bush calls, "appearance problem" by
using a government limousine for a private trip to a stamp auction in
New York. The President denied he was angry with Sununu and said his
job was safe, adding that there is a "piling-on syndrome" feeding the
publicity about Sununu's travel.
