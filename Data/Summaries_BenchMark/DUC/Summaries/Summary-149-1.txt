Ben Johnson's physician, Dr. Jamie Astaphan, said that Johnson took
banned steroid, stanzolol, once, four months before the Seoul
Olympics.  It caused him violent muscle spasms.  Astaphan said that
Johnson was not on the drug when he beat Carl Lewis in a world record
time of 9.79 seconds for 100 meters.  When asked how he could be
certain, Astaphan said that he did not have a constant check on
Johnson but doubted that he would return to a drug that caused him a
problem earlier.  Commission counsel said it was irresponsible to make
such statements outside the commission.
