Last year's Armenian earthquake, with 25,000 killed, (13,000 injured
and half a million homeless) brought the earth's yearly death total to
its highest since 1976, when 10 times many died in a Chinese
earthquake.  2,000 more died in other quakes last year.

The geological survey reported 61 significant quakes last year,
including sites on the Nepal-Burma border, the Nepal-India border and
the Burma-China border.  The United States recorded three significant
quakes, in the Gulf of Alaska, Whittier and Pasadena, California.
Canada had one; Europe, Africa and Japan also recorded relatively
minor quakes.
