On Saturday, British and French workers digging the Channel tunnel
finally met after knocking out a passage large enough to walk through.
French President Mitterand said, "What a brilliant sign of the
vitality of our two countries." The $16.7-billion Channel tunnel will
make it possible to travel from Paris to London by high-speed train in
3-1/2 hours, including 35 minutes through the tunnel.  It takes 90
minutes by ferry.

The tunnel is viewed positively in France where it is expected to
revive economically depressed northern areas.  Many Britons fear drug
traffickers will invade their island via the tunnel.
