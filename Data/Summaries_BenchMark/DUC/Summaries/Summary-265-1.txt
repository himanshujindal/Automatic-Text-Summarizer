The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas have brought their own brand of law
and order to the Upper Huallaga River Valley.  The group has the
reputation of almost puritanical honesty and has gained the support of
tens of thousands of farmers.  They always pay for food and supplies
and have banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and thievery,
killing those who disobey.  Peruvian officials call the insurgents
lunatic killers, but residents feel protected from the violence,
abuses and corruption brought by the police.  Residents say the
Shining Path is quick to kill local officials they deem to be
corrupt.
