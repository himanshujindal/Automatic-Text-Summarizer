The Senate debate on a new immigration bill examines the question on
who should be counted in the process that will allocate House seats in
the 1990 census. Specifically, whether illegal aliens should be
counted in the 1990 Census.

The Census Bureau maintains that an accurate count will not be
possible if the illegal immigrants are left out. There could be enough
aliens to shift seats from up to five states to Sun Belt states with
large alien populations.

The government estimated that there are more than 2.57 million illegal
aliens living throughout the nation.

The Senatorial debate may force a Supreme Court ruling on this
constitutional issue.
