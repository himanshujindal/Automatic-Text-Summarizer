The Shining Path is now gaining support among farmers in the jungles
of the Upper Huallaga Valley.  From July 1984 to December 1985 this
area was under a state of emergency and controlled by the army, which
reportedly collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from drug lords.
When President Garcia lifted the state of emergency, the army lost
control and the Shining Path moved in.  Reportedly, the guerrillas are
demanding one-fifth of the farmer's coca crop in return for
protection.  The Shining Path is organizing self-defense groups to
oppose the anti-drug police and coca-eradication personnel.
