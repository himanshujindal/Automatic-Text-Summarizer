Thousands more acres of brush and timber went up in smoke Saturday in
seven states in the West, threatening homes in some places.

Fire crews were at work in Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico,
Arizona, California and Washington.  Elsewhere, four big fires burned
in interior Alaska, one having charred an estimated 24,000 acres.  A
fire in Georgia's Okefenoke swamp that burned 500 acres of habitat for
an endangered species of woodpecker was reported under control.

The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho listed 7,000 to 7,500
people on the fire lines.  So far this season, the agency has had
31,000 fires reported.
