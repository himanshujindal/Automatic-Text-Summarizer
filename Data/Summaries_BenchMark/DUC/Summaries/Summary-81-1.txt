Results of a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine
show that individuals infected with the AIDS virus, especially drug
users, are at increased risk of developing tuberculosis.  Only about
10 percent of the general populace who carry the tuberculosis bacteria
ever develop the disease, but the risk is much greater for those who
carry the latent tuberculosis bacteria and then contract AIDS. Not
only are they at greater risk themselves but, because tuberculosis is
more easily passed on than AIDs, they can transmit it to health care
workers, caseworkers and others.
