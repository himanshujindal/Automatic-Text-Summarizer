A computer study suggests the 1988 drought in the Midwest may have
been caused by bands of ocean abnormal temperature near the equator in
the Pacific Ocean.  While meteorologists often blame such droughts on
the jet stream being north of its usual position, this is not the
cause.  In April-June 1988, there were alternating high and low
pressure centers across the northern Western Hemisphere preventing the
normal flow of weather systems.  Computer modeling suggests that these
centers were related to unusual ocean temperature variations observed
in the Pacific.  If valid, monitoring ocean temperature may provide
forewarning of droughts.
