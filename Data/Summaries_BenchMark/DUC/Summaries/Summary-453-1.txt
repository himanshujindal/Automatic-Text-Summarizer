Mount Pinatubo erupted today with six huge explosions and a mushroom
cloud that blocked out the sun.  Amidst panic by local residents and
clogged exit roads, huge stones, searing gas and molten rock raced
down the 4795-foot mountain. Most of the debris flowed into three
rivers.

About 3,000 Aeta tribesmen who are descendants of the original
inhabitants of the Philippines were stunned by the explosion and fled
down the slopes ahead of the debris.

There are about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanos in the Philippines.
The last eruption was Taal Volcano in 1965 which claimed 200
lives.
