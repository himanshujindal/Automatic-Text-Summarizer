The number of cases of tuberculosis reported in Latvia during 1993 was
868, compared to 771 in 1992. The number of deaths increased at an
even greater rate of 41 percent. The State Tuberculosis and Lung
Center said that poor socioeconomic conditions could account for the
increase. Latvia does not have a law that would require mandatory
treatment for infectious cases of tuberculosis. The Department of
Health submitted a proposal for such a law but no action has been
taken. There are 11 state tuberculosis hospitals in Latvia that
provide free care for those with active cases.
