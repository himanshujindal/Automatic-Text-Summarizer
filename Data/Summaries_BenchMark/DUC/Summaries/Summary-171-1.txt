Exxon has a revised plan for cleaning 364 miles of Alaskan coastline
fouled by the nation's largest oil spill, but the plan is to end in
September and would require suspension of local environmental laws.
Sludge and tar from the spill fouled beaches of Katmai National Park
killing animals and birds and even threatening the huge brown bears.
The damage extended southwest of Valdez for some 500 miles.  Coast
Guard Admiral Yost would decide whether to approve the plan within a
week.  The oil industry blames the spill for increase in crude prices
and higher costs at the gas pumps.
