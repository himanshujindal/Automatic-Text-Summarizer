The World Health Organization, after the first global study of
tuberculosis in a decade, said the disease is now the worlds deadliest
infectious disease. The disease kills nearly three million a year,
most between the ages of 15 and 59. It is anticipated that the number
of deaths will rise sharply, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin
America and Southeast Asia. The increases already seen and those
anticipated are attributed in large measure to the connection between
AIDS and tuberculosis. At one time experts thought that tuberculosis
was on a path to extinction, and its now epidemic proportion is
disheartening.
