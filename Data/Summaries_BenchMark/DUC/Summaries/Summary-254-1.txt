The Agriculture Department reports that it has been on top of the
drought since March 1, when a drought task force was established.  A
"USDA Backgrounder" was released listing actions.  The only two which
involved money were an extra $50 million to buy beef for feeding
programs and allowing Mexico to buy $40 million worth of meat.
Actions have included allowing use for grazing and hay cutting of
acreage in conservation programs, Congressional briefings, interagency
meetings, news conferences, daily weather updates, a toll-free hotline
on federal services available, and crop surveys.
