West Germany has joined France in a ban on British beef imports due to
concern over "mad cow disease" (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or
BSE). Despite assurances from the British government that the beef is
safe, some are skeptical and the price of British beef is
dropping. British officials believe that France and West Germany
imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales. European Community
commissioners have also protested the import ban. On May 11 it was
reported that a Siamese cat had died from a form of BSE and the press
went wild suggesting that if cats can get it people can too.</SUM>
