National Security Adviser Colin Powell, in a speech to the National
Press Club Thursday, credited Mikhail Gorbachev for pushing economic
reform and acknowledging the problems the Soviet system faces, but
added it remains to be seen whether it can be fixed as long as it
remains a communist, one-party system.  He said that resistance forces
fighting communism and totalitarians have made great strides in
Afghanistan, Angola, and Cambodia.  He added, "....a principle lesson
to be learned from the various regional conflicts is that American
foreign policy has tended to succeed in instances in which U.S.
support was unquestioned,"; e.g., Afghanistan.
