In Madrid, Spain, 39 nations reached a tentative compromise on
updating the Antarctica Treaty by calling for a 50-year moratorium on
mining and mineral exploration.  While other nations pushed for a
permanent ban on commercial exploitation, U.S. and British delegates
held out for a short moratorium.  When the moratorium expires it may
be lifted only with approval of two-thirds of the signatories.  This
agreement continues the 30-year Antarctic Treaty tradition of
preserving Antarctica for scientific research and keeping it
off-limits to military bases, commercial development and mining, which
may prove more beneficial than digging up and selling off its
resources.
