At the end of a high-speed chase in Santa Clara County a police
officer takes his baton and brutally hits the suspect on the back
eight times, kicks him in the face, picks him up by the shoulders and
slams his face into the pavement.  The suspect suffers a dislocated
shoulder, a concussion, and numerous cuts, bruises and contusions. The
officer's report states that the suspect's injuries were due to a fall
from his bike. None of the back-up officers reported any
brutality. All too often a code of silence blocks prosecution of
police brutality. That is why we need citizen review boards.
