In June President Reagan signed a law banning about 85 percent of the
current use of polygraphs. Yesterday the Labor Department issued
regulations implementing the law.  About seven million private
employers will no longer be allowed to require job seekers or those on
the payroll to take a polygraph test, under penalty of a $10,000
fine. The employers must post signs summarizing the prohibitions and
exceptions.  Companies providing security services are exempt, as are
drug companies for those actually handling drugs. Polygraphs can still
be used to investigate specific occurrences of theft, embezzlement and
sabotage.
