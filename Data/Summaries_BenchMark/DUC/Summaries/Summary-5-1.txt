"Mad cow disease" (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE), has been
found in Britain's sparsely scattered antelope population, including
elands, kuru and an Arabian oryx. In all, six species other than
cattle have been confirmed with the disease over the past three
years. There has also been a pronounced increase in the number of
sheep affected by the ovine form of the disease ("scrapie") with 894
cases diagnosed in 1991 compared to just 348 in 1990. Since 1989 the
condition has been confirmed in 23 cats and 29 goats. There is not
sufficient data to conclude how the disease is spread.
