Why the controversy surrounding Judge Bork's nomination to the Supreme
Court?  Is it because he makes "neutral-principled" decisions based on
established law irrespective of who may win or lose?  He believes in
judicial restraint, sticking with legal principle rather than what is
"good" or "moral" or "right" within current activists' social,
economic or criminal-justice agendas.  Bork says the job of a judge is
to understand the principle that the framers were trying to protect
and apply that principle in today's circumstances, always protecting
the value or the freedom that the framers were trying to protect ---
and not some new freedom.
