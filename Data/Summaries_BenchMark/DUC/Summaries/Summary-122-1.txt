Some members of congress argue that the Second Amendment's "..right to
bear arms." precludes any legislation designed to control arms.

Another view is that the Second Amendment provides a solid basis for
effective gun control legislation.  Justification for this point of
view is based on an interpretation of the Amendment's wording in the
light of the situation existing in 1792.

For purposes of gun control today, it would mean that Congress require
owners to register their firearms with the National Guard.  This would
provide the necessary information concerning owners as required by the
Brady Bill and other gun control legislation.
