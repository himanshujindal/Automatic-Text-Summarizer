Thousands are preparing to witness the July 11 total eclipse of the
sun.  Talismans of all sorts, protective viewing lenses and "power
vortex" energy gathering crystals are being sold at locations along
the eclipse's path.  Meanwhile, authorities in the primary viewing
areas, Mexico's Baja California Sur and the big island of Hawaii are
concerned that the infrastructure may not be adequate to accommodate
the expected crowds. Hawaii is expecting 30,000 more tourists than the
normal 18,000 for this time of year.  Transportation systems will be
strained. Further, everyone is being warned extensively about serious
eye damage caused by improper viewing.
