Charles Keating probably had strong feelings of being a victim of
persecution when federal authorities seized his troubled Lincoln
Savings and Loan. His anger may have also surfaced when the same
regulators justified the seizure by lowering the total value of the
company's assets to a figure of one- half of its liabilities. The
federal charge estimated the thrift's assets were worth only 2-2.5
billion dollars and that the discrepancy in funds could cost taxpayers
two billion dollars.

Keating also made charges of federal mismanagement of his seized
savings and loan during a hearing in which he is attempting to recover
his company.
