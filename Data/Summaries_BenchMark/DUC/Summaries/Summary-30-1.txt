The commission that was appointed by Mayor Bradley and Police Chief
Gates to investigate the Rodney King beating by Los Angeles police was
to release its report today. According to an anonymous source the
report neither blames nor clears Chief Gates.  Gates has said he would
resign if the commission agreed with critics that he created a climate
within the police department that condoned racism and brutality. The
American Civil Liberties Union and other groups called for Gates to
resign after the March 3 incident in which white police officers
repeatedly struck King with batons, kicked him and shocked him with a
stun gun.
