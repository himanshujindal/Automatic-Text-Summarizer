United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said American
hostage Terry Anderson had been freed today by his Shiite Muslim
captors and was safely in Syrian hands. Earlier in the day, it was not
clear where Anderson was, despite reports from Arab and U.S. officials
that he was released and turned over to the Syrians.

Heavy snow delayed Anderson's transfer from Beirut to Damascus, which
caused the confusion about Anderson's whereabouts.

"The causes of this troubled episode are complex and difficult,"
Anderson said in a statement.  "It is these causes which must be
redressed and eliminated.  The holding of innocent people by anyone
solves nothing."
