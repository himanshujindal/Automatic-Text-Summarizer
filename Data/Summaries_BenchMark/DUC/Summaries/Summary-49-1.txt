In Huntsville, Alabama, a tornado, without warning, carved a
three-mile stretch of destruction, killing 17 people, injuring 463 and
leaving 1,000 homeless.  It hopped along a 25-mile path plowing
through a school, rural areas, a shopping mall and adjacent
apartments.  It tossed cars and trucks on Interstate 85.  It was one
of a series that touched down in seven states from the Deep South to
the Midwest.  Later, a tornado watch was issued for the Atlantic coast
and New England states.  This was Alabama's deadliest twister since
1975 when 22 people died in Birmingham.  Officials are requesting
federal disaster assistance.
