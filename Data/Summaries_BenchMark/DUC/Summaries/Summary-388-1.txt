The Iranian Republic News Agency announced that an Iranian Air Airbus
flying a scheduled flight from Bandar Abbas to Dubai had been shot
down, and all 290 on board were presumed dead.  The commercial
airliner was destroyed by missiles fired from the USS Vincennes
Aegis-type cruiser.  The Vincennes is the fourth vessel to carry the
name of the city of Indiana.  The Vincennes Organization is made up of
sailors who had served on earlier ships of that name. Members of the
organization, speaking out only a day after the shootdown, voiced
strong support for the crew of the Vincennes.
