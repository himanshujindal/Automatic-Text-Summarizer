Before Slovenia declared independence, any foreign exchange deposits
which Yugoslav citizens deposited in Slovenian banks were transferred
to the former National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY).  Since independence,
these accounts have been frozen. Slovenian bank officials hope the
Slovenian government will guarantee these debts and open negotiations
with the NBY but think it will be years before people obtain their
money.  Settling relations with the NBY, establishing new relations
with foreign creditors, and getting recognition by the US would
improve Slovenia's economic prospects and speed its admission to the
IMF and World Bank. Slovenia will not renege on its allocated share of
the federal debt.
