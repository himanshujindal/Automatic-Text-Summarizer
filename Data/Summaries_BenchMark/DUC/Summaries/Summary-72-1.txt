A United States Air Force F-16C fighter, on a routine training flight
from Misawa Air Base in Northern Japan, crashed in a remote forested
area in Iwate Prefecture.  The pilot, Major Wyman Vanedoe, was the
sole occupant of the aircraft.  He bailed out and was evacuated back
to his base in a Japanese rescue helicopter.  About 50 F-16s at Misawa
belong to the 14th Tactical Fighter Squadron, and another of the
squadron's jets had crashed into the Pacific Ocean in March 1987. That
pilot also successfully bailed out and was rescued.
