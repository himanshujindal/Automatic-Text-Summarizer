President Bush delivered an ultimatum to Iraq to begin immediate and
unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.  The withdrawal from Kuwait City
must be complete within 48 hours and from the country in one week.
Further, Iraq must release all prisoners of war and third-country
citizens within 48 hours.  The subject of war reparations was not
mentioned.  Shortly thereafter, the Soviet announced a six-point set
of provisions containing Iraqi agreement to withdraw from Kuwait
within 21 days of a cease-fire.

Bush accused Saddam of launching a scorched earth policy in Kuwait by
setting fire to the oil fields.  Round-the-clock U.S. air attacks
continue.
