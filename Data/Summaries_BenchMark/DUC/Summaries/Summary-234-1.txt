With a shoestring budget, NAFTA foes have worked for 3 years to win
over the American public. They have signed a Declaration of War
against NAFTA, written alternative menus featuring toxic-laden Mexican
produce for a Trade Representative dinner, driven caravans through
states showing films of Mexico's environmental degradation, and
financed an office for "anti-NAFTA czar" former Indiana congressman
Jim Jontz. NAFTA's business-community proponents are spending millions
to convince Congress to pass NAFTA, bypassing the voters. Both sides
are cranking up lobbying efforts for this week's conclusion of talks
over labor and environment side agreements, which the opposition calls
a fig leaf.
