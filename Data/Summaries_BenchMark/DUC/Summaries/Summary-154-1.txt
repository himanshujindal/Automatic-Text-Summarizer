Canadian sprint coach Charlie Francis testifying in 1988 in a Toronto
inquiry about use of performance-enhancing drugs made it plain that he
had given his athletes every steroid combination imaginable.  His star
pupil, Ben Johnson, ran 100 meters in 9.79 seconds in the Seoul
Olympics but lost his Gold Medal when he tested positive for drug use.
Francis said that steroid use permits an athlete to train harder but
not run faster.  Francis says steroid use is rampant.  After a two
year ban, Johnson is running again without Francis' coaching.  Francis
believes that without steroids, Johnson cannot be the fastest,
although still fast.
