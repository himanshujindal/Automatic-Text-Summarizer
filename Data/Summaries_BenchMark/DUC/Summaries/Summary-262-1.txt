On Sunday, the Peruvian Police captured Osman Morote, the top military
leader of the Shining Path, a Maoist rebel group.  Morote had arrived
in Lima a week ago to coordinate terrorist attacks in Lima.  The
Shining Path was founded by Abimael Guzman.  It is a splinter of the
Peruvian Communist Party and is seeking to overthrow Peru's elected
government and install a peasant and worker state.  Eight years ago
the group took up arms after conducting semi-clandestine political
work with peasants in the Andean highlands for 10 years.  Guzman, not
seen for years, still is recognized at the group's leader.
