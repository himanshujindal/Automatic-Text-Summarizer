As hurricane Andrew headed west along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico,
government officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas yesterday
urged more than two million people to evacuate coastal areas. The
likeliest landfall is to the west of New Orleans, a city particularly
vulnerable to flooding since it lies below sea level, has the
Mississippi River running through it, and has a large lake immediately
to its north. In Florida, Andrew hit hardest 10-15 miles south of
Miami, leveling the town of Homestead and a nearby air force base. It
was estimated today that damage from Andrew could reach $20
billion.
