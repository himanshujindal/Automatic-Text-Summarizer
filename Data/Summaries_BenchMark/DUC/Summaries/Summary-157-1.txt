Ben Johnson was second in his first race since the ban.  He lost to
Daron Council by .02 seconds in a 50 meter dash at the Hamilton
Spectator Games.  The brief race produced a record crowd of 17,050 and
nearly 500 journalists from 14 countries.  Johnson was satisfied with
his performance despite a poor start.  "I got caught in the blocks",
he said.  Johnson didn't appear as bulky in his upper body as before
but still weighed the same, 174 pounds, and could still bench press
365 pounds.  He said he was in good shape but not racing shape.
