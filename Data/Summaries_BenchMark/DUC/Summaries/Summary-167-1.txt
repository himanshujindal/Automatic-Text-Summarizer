Exxon crews finished pumping the remaining crude from the Exxon
Valdez, preparing to refloat the vessel.  Exxon planned to pump air
into the hold to aid in refloating the vessel.  They said that the
oil-catching boom put around the ship after an 11 hour delay, could
have touched off an explosion of gases from the oil. The family of
fired Exxon Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood, said he wanted to
surrender but awaits advice from counsel.  The state told fishermen it
would not allow a herring season this year.  Ordinally, a harvest is
usually worth about $12M.  Sablefish and shrimp fisheries have also
been closed.
