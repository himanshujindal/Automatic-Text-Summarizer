The Exxon Valdez, a California-bound oil tanker, struck a reef and
spilled 8.4M gallons of crude in Alaska's Prince William Sound on 24
March.  A US Fish and Wildlife Service representative said the
987-foot tanker was spilling oil at the rate of 10,000 barrels an
hour. But a Coast Guard spokesman said that the spill had slowed to a
trickle by afternoon Friday and did not seem to be moving ashore.
Environmentalists feared that wildlife would be threatened, especially
if the oil reached shore, and were concerned about the slow pace of
the cleanup.  Alaskan Governor Cowper arrived in Valdez on Friday to
evaluate the spill.
