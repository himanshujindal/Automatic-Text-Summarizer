On Friday, Serbia, Slovenia and Croatia agreed to a
European-Community-brokered cease-fire that called for federal troops
in Slovenia to return to barracks, a three-month delay in carrying out
Slovenia's and Croatia's independence declarations, and installation
of the Croatian federal president.  Slovenian insistence on approval
by its parliament caused Serbian president Milosevic to delay the
installation. On Saturday the Yugoslav army ordered Slovenia to halt
attacks against federal forces or face decisive military action,
confirming fears that the army is acting outside government
control. Preparations for hostilities are widespread. Fighting killed
40 people. Deputy Secretary of State Eagleburger said the US might
consider recognizing Croatia and Slovenia.
