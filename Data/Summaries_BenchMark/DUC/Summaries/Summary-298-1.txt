All sixteen aboard a twin engine Otter were killed after it crashed
into a mountain in Ethiopia. The wreckage was found after a six day
search in poor weather.  U.S. Army search helicopters had to lower men
to the ground at the site, since there was no landing area on the
mountainside, where the grade is 60%.

The plane was carrying Representative Mickey Leland of Texas to an
Ethiopian refugee camp, one of several he was touring as Chairman of
the House Select Committee on Hunger, which he helped to
establish. Other government officials were aboard.  The cause of the
crash is under investigation.
