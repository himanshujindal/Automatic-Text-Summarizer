Elizabeth Taylor battled pneumonia at her hospital, assisted by a
ventilator, doctors say.

Hospital officials described her condition late Monday as stabilizing
after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of the pneumonia.  Analysis
of the tissue sample was expected to be complete by Thursday.

Ms. Sam, a spokeswoman said "it is serious, but they are really
pleased with her progress.  She's not well.  She's not on her deathbed
or anything."

Another spokeswoman, Lisa Del Favaro, said Miss Taylor's family was at
her bedside.

During a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961, Miss Taylor
underwent a tracheotomy to help her breathe.
