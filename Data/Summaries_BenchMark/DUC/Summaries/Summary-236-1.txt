Grassroots environmental organizations, helped by economic
sluggishness and regular corporate layoff announcements, have fanned
anti-NAFTA sentiment to its highest level yet.  They warn NAFTA will
undermine environmental protection work and deny it would create
200,000 jobs in the next 5 years. President Clinton insists global
marketplace realities must be faced. President Carter attacked Perot
as a rich demagogue, Bush praised Mexican President Salinas, and Ford
said immigrants would overrun the US without work at home. Government
agencies were instructed to boost NAFTA in public forums. House
Speaker Tom Foley says much of what people fear will happen more
quickly without NAFTA than with it.
