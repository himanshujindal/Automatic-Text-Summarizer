Two United States Navy F-14 fighters crashed yesterday, one plunging
into the Atlantic Ocean off North Carolina and the other crashing into
a hangar at its base at Gillespie near San Diego.  Six persons on the
ground were injured in the California crash, but the crewmen bailed
out shortly before impact.  The dead body of one of the aviators
involved in the crash off Cape Hatteras was recovered, but his
crewmate is missing.  A third military aircraft, a United States F-16A
from Hill Air Base in Utah crashed today.  The pilot bailed from the
plane that went down 25 miles west of the base.
