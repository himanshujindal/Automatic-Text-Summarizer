Anti-NAFTA demonstrators in Virginia said NAFTA undermines the
constitution and judicial system by putting decision-making in the
hands of international panels.  Virginia's tax base would be a concern
as companies moved production to Mexico and placed downward pressure
on wages. Demonstrators published lists of business contributors to
pro-NAFTA congressmen, and said President Clinton was buying off
undecideds with promises of new projects in their districts. One
undecided congressman, a member of the armed services committee with
many military in his district, expected to be influenced by NAFTA's
foreign policy implications, but said if offered a decent project he
might find it tough to say no.
