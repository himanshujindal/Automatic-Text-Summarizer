Michael Robert Milken's shrewd trading of junk bonds made millions for
Drexel Burnham Lambert and for himself. In 1978 he convinced Drexel to
let him move its junk bond operations from New York to Los Angeles. An
intense workaholic, Milken Typically worked 15-hour days. By the time
he turned 42 Milken had become one of the nation's richest men with a
net worth of close to $1 billion. Now Drexel faces federal charges of
an array of securities violations and the firm has announced that
Milken will be fired. Drexel is expected to plead guilty and in all
likelihood, separate charges will be filed against Milken.
