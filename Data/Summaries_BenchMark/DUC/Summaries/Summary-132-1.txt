Patience paid off for the two winners of the Chicago Marathon on
Sunday.  Heat and humidity, as well as strong winds, sapped the
strength of the runners, however.

Paul Davies-Hale, and Englishman and Lisa Weidenbach from Washington
state both held back in a conservative race, saving their energy for
the last few miles.

Davies-Hale's winning time was 2:11:25, the second slowest in this
marathon's history.  Weidenbach's time was a very respectable 2:28:15.

Weather conditions for the race were poor, with temperatures in the
mid-60's, 53 percent humidity, and strong winds.  Forty degree
temperatures with cloud cover are ideal.
