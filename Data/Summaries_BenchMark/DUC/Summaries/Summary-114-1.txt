Pneumonia-Stricken actress Elizabeth Taylor has suffered complications
in her fifth week of hospitalization and doctors say she will be
hospitalized six more weeks for intravenous therapy.

Bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection her doctors said today have
complicated the recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with
a viral pneumonia.

"Miss Taylor has a resolving, newly acquired bacterial pneumonia
secondary to her hospital stay at St. John's Hospital and Health
Center," the doctors said.

Bacterial pneumonia is generally considered less serious than the
viral pneumonia Taylor initially contracted because antibiotics are
effective against bacteria but not viruses.
