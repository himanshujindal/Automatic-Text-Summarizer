Anti-abortion demonstrators charge that police in more than 50 cities
have used excessive force against them. Retired Roman Catholic Bishop
George Lynch of New York vividly described the pain suffered when he
was apprehended by West Hartford, Conn. police in 1989. The
demonstrators claim that police tactics in Denver, Atlanta, Pittsburgh
and Los Angeles have resulted in serious injury and led to sexual
abuse against women who have been arrested. While the beating of
Rodney King by Los Angeles police has led to widespread calls for
investigation of police brutality, little attention has been directed
to police brutality and abuse suffered by the anti-abortion
demonstrators.
