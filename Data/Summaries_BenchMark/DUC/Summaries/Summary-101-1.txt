Three hours of steady rain Monday provided a much-needed edge to crews
working to douse a blaze in Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming.

Meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blaze that
raged across 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park in California
over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-day fire in
Michigan's Hiawatha National Forest under control Monday.

Four 20-person crews from Colorado, Utah and South Dakota were
expected to arrive at the Shoshone fire by Monday night, putting the
total number of firefighters to 430.

At least 60 firefighters brought the Hiawatha forest fire under
control Monday.
