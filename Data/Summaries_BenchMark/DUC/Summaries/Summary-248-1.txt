Slovenia's stocks shot up with its secession from Yugoslavia on June
25, but then slumped with unease about the future. The European
Community hesitates to recognize Slovenia and Croatia, for whom it
brokered a peace plan, for fear of encouraging its own
minorities. Slovenia is used to being considered prosperous and
Western and is disillusioned at feeling poor and shunned. Slovenia
needs to find new markets to replace Yugoslavian markets, which
purchased a quarter of Slovenia's goods. Exports need to double to
match European standards. A major motivation behind Slovenia's
independence was to free itself from the "Yugoslav risk" that
discouraged foreign investment.
