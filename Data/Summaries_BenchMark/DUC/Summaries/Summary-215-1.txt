Prolonged drought, bark beetles and a rare fungus are drying out and
killing brush and trees that surround many Southern California
neighborhoods, creating the potential for one of the worst wildfire
seasons in decades.  Most vulnerable in the 1990 season are the
chaparral-covered foothills and mountain canyon slopes beside densely
developed residential districts of Los Angeles and its suburbs.  The
area's average rainfall is 14.93 inches.  Only 6.15 inches have fallen
this year.  The dead and drying brush forms a highly volatile fuel
source.  Residents should clear tall grass, brush, trash, and firewood
at least 30 feet from any building.
