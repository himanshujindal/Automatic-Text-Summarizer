A suit was filed in the United States Court in San Francisco on June
28 on behalf of 83 of the 290 killed when missiles fired from the USS
Vincennes shot down an Iranian airliner. The suit charges General
Electric and other entities that designed and manufactured the Aegis
system aboard the Vincennes. A spokesman also said that claims would
be filed against the government of the United States. Iran has been
asking for a World Court verdict against the United States, demanding
compensation in an unspecified amount to be paid to families of the
victims.
