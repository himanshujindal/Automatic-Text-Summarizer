The latest postmortem of the 1988 drought in nine Midwestern states,
reveals it was not as bad as it might have been.  Net farm income
decreased in drought areas by almost $10,000.  Farms in all areas
continued to improve their solvency position, and the number of
financially vulnerable farms continues to decrease.  Farms survived by
selling- off inventories, taking advantage of higher market prices,
and receiving the disaster relief money.  The report noted higher
prices helped reduce the direct payments to farmers under USDA's
commodity programs.
