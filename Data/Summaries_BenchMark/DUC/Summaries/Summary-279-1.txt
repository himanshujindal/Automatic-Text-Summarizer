Albert Hunt reports that pollsters have found the public losing
confidence in the electoral system and the Congress.  People want more
representation and this is the impetus behind the momentum for
limiting terms of lawmakers.  Hunt believes these limits would result
in more power going to the unelected staff and lobbyists.  Voters
should never be prevented from electing who they think is best.  Other
solutions might be eliminating some of Congress' perquisites and a
fundamental overhaul of the committee system.  Legislators now are put
on a committee and stay there, becoming stale and locked into outdated
approaches.  The length of committee assignments should be
limited.
