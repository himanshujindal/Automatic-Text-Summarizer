The Shining Path guerrillas are attempting to move into the
shantytowns surrounding Lima, especially Huaycan, which lies along
near the Central Highway, a strategic route through the main
industrial zone.  For the last 18 months, the Shining Path has been
taking a more public role in the slums, labor unions, and student
groups, and with its newspaper "El Diario".  Believed to have only
about 5,000 armed combatants, the group has struck in the mountains,
worked with drug traffickers in the jungle, and bought weapons with
profits.  Founded by Guzman, a Marxist philosophy professor, the group
grew in the Indian community, long persecuted by the ruling
elite.
