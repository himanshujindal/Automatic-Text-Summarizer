Actress Elizabeth Taylor and the National Enquirer said they reached a
settlement in Miss Taylor's $20 million lawsuit against the newspaper
tabloid.

The lawsuit rose out of two articles published by the Enquirer in June
1990 reporting on Miss Taylor's condition and activities at St. John's
Hospital where she was treated for pneumonia.

The Enquirer said that after reviewing Miss Taylor's medical records,
it is satisfied the articles reporting that she was drinking were in
error.

The amount of the settlement was not disclosed but her attorney, Neil
Papiano said, "we were persuaded that it was certainly large enough
that we shouldn't go to trial."
