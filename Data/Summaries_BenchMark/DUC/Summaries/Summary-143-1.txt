The Bank of Boston has begun a new policy in banking circles. It has
written-off as uncollectible loans to Third World countries.

The Bank of Boston, a regional bank, has an advantage over money-
centered banks like those in New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Bank
of Boston has a large loan-loss reserve that the large banks lack.

The inhibiting factor for regional banks is once you have been burned
by the need to write-off a loan, you are much less likely to join any
new such effort.

Other regional banks may follow Bank of Boston's lead.
