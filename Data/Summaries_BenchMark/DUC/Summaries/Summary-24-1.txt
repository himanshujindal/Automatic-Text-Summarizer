A videotape being shown nationwide catches Los Angeles police officers
intentionally hurting nonviolent anti-abortion demonstrators. They
press fingers under their noses, dig their knuckles into
demonstrators' necks, and torque martial arts weapons around their
wrists. The police call these techniques "pain-compliance." Opponents
call them torture.  Injuries have been mounting ever since police and
Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic
convention in Atlanta. Since then there have been charges of police
brutality in San Diego, Pittsburgh, West Hartford, Conn., Boston, and
Denver. Last November 15, President Bush signed legislation
withholding certain federal grants from cities whose police use
excessive force.
