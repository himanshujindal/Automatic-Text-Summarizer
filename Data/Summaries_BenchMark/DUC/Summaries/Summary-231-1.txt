De Beers' 100-year old Kimberley diamond mines are running out but it
is maintaining output and market stability in the face of Russian
export uncertainty by expanding other mines. Millions are being put
into the Jwaneng mine in Botswana to continue open pit digging for 35
years, after which mining may go underground. Jwaneng, the richest
diamond mine in the world, is co-owned by Botswana and De Beers and is
the major Botswana revenue source. At the De Beers-owned Finsch mine
in South Africa, digging has gone underground to give the mine another
35-40 years of life, with remote- controlled trucks digging out
material in dangerous areas.
