The prediction of a major earthquake along the New Madrid Fault is
causing a stir in Tennessee.  Some to plan to leave the area; there
are plans to close schools and businesses in December and others are
crowding into earthquake survival classes.  This is a result of a
prediction by Iben Browning, a scientist who predicted the Bay Area
and Mexico City quakes.

This area suffered a series of earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 estimated
to be higher than an 8 on the then non-existent Richter scale.  The
New Madrid fault is 120 miles long.
