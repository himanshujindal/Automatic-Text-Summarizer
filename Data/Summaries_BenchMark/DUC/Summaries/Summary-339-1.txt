A coalition of environmental groups is calling on participants to a
Chilean conference on Antarctica to designate the continent as a world
science park.  The environmentalists claim that Antarctica is being
marred by air pollution, tourist ships, threatened by mining and
damaged by more than 76 scientific projects now underway on the
continent.  Tucker Scully, lead U.S. negotiator for Antarctic issues,
disagreed with the hands-off approach to the continent, calling it
sticking one's head in the sand.  There is speculation that the
Interior Department may urge President Bush to veto pending
congressional legislation calling for the preservation of Antarctica
