After years of preparation, four men and four women Thursday shut the
door on the world they hope to aid and began two years of ecological
research in Biosphere II, an airtight, three-acre structure of glass
and steel that has stirred controversy as well as awe.  At midmorning,
the eight told project officials they were about to begin work on
their respective "biome" or ecosystem.  They will recycle their air,
water and waste, and live off a half-acre of land and plants grown in
tanks of water fused with nutrients, seeking possibilities of living
in artificial atmospheres in outer space.
