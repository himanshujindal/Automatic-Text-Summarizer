From January 16 through February 21, U.S. and allied air forces have
conducted ferocious bombing attacks against the Iraqi military and
national infrastructure.  Iraq has responded with missile attacks
against Saudi Arabia and Israel.  Iraq now proposes an eight-point
settlement plan offering full and unconditional withdrawal from
Kuwait.  However, U.N. sanctions must be lifted and resolutions
condemning and punishing Iraq must cease.  President Bush has serious
problems with the plan.  It essentially would leave Saddam in power
with his Republican Guard and a significant military establishment
still intact.  Leaders of Israel and bordering Arab states still fear
an armed Saddam Hussein.
