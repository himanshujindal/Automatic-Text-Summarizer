The Christopher Commission, appointed after the videotaped March 3
beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles policemen, has issued a report
that paints a picture of brutality and racism in the police
department, calls for the resignation of Chief Gates, and could prompt
changes in law enforcement nationwide. Nearly one- quarter of 650
officers responding to a commission survey agreed that "racial bias on
the part of officers toward minority citizens currently exists and
contributes to a negative interaction between police and community."
One of the commission members commented "As troubling as some of our
findings are...they are not unique to Los Angeles."
