Multitudes of native peoples, tourists and scientists today observed a
sun that was blackened for up to four minutes.  The total eclipse
along a 108-mile swath moved from the Indian Ocean across Indonesia
and the southern Philippine island of Mindanao and ended in the Gulf
of Alaska.  A partial eclipse was visible as far west as India.
Despite scattered clouds in much of the eclipse area, scientists were
confident they had taken useful pictures.  Native peoples celebrated
the event with cheering, dancing, drums, festivals and indigenous
rituals.  The Chinese first recorded a total solar eclipse in 2137
B.C.
