The gun control movement in the U.S. sprouted from Roger B. Taney, the
racist chief justice of the U.S. and author of the Dred Scott decision
of 1857.

Dred Scott was a slave who sued for his freedom.  The case went to the
U.S.  Supreme Court.  Chief Justice Taney ruled against Scott, saying
that a slave was not a citizen and therefore of no standing in court.

The decision by Taney was eventually carried over into the context of
the Second Amendment due to the racial paranoia about black men with
guns.  This paranoia resulted in restrictions being placed on gun
ownership.
