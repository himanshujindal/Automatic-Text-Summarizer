Many people in Miami worry about the "Big One", a devastating
hurricane that could cause untold damage to the city.  "Surprise"
hurricanes like the Galveston hurricane in 1900 that killed 6000 are
unlikely, but scientists expect a major hurricane to hit within 75
miles of Miami every eight years.  If a really major storm were to hit
Miami today, it would be totally different from the big hurricane that
hit Miami in 1926.  A storm today with winds topping 155 mph could
cause water levels to reach 9 feet on Biscayne Boulevard in downtown
Miami and over 13 feet in low lying areas south of the city.
