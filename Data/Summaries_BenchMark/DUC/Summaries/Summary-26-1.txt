On March 15, 1988 detective Clayton Searle was at the Los Angeles
International Airport looking for a drug courier. He spotted a man
making a phone call and, according to the suspect, grabbed his
shoulder, spun him around and asked him to identify himself. Then
Searle grabbed the suspect by the neck, they fell to the floor, the
officer put a knee on the suspect's back, and handcuffed him. The
suspect was Joe Morgan, the former Cincinnati Reds second
baseman. Morgan is suing in federal court claiming that he suffered
this treatment because he is black and fit a certain "profile" used by
narcotics officers.
