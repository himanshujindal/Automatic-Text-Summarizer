Associated Press' tracking of the 1988 drought relief package shows it
did help those most in need.  In North Dakota, the nation's most
agriculturally dependent state, more that 49,000 producers shared
$410.2 million.  The state lost two-thirds of its 1988 spring wheat.
The disaster payments reduced statewide losses by $1.2 billion.  Other
drought-ravaged states were Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Disaster aid and crop insurance put $500 million into Iowa's economy,
staving off bankruptcies and other financial problems.  A university
survey reported drought aid added $15,000 to the average farmer's net
cash income of $6,300.  These states still need a good year to get
back on their feet, and it was not 1989.
