The Senate today confirmed Clarence Thomas as a judge to serve on the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He was
confirmed by a voice vote. One of the most highly placed blacks in the
Reagan and Bush administrations, Thomas has been serving as the
Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Civil rights
leaders have been divided on his nomination. He is a critic of
affirmative action and quotas. Conservatives have praised Thomas'
service on the EEOC, but liberals have criticized him for his failure
to act on 15,000 age-discrimination cases.
