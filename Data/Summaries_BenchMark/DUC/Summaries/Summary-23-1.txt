A Chicago City Council committee held two days of hearings last week
on allegations of police brutality against blacks. Blacks who alleged
they were the victims of police brutality accused officers--most of
them white--of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and
insulting them with racial slurs. A 55-year-old grandmother testified
that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven white police
officers who gave her "the sign of the Ku Klux Klan." Mayor Richard
M. Daley declared, "I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or
bigotry in the city of Chicago. Everyone should join together...to
help alleviate this problem."
