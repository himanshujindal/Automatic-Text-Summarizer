Nelson Polsby does not believe term limits will give their proponents
what they want.  Term limitation will not decrease the influence of
interest groups and their money because new candidates need even more
money to get recognition.  Inexperienced legislators must learn their
job from the legislative staff, bureaucrats and lobbyists, thus
shifting the power from the elected officials.  We should vote poor
performers out.  Terms limits would only throw the good out with the
bad.  He also fears the main supporters of term limits are those who
are assuming non-incumbents are easier to beat or buy.
