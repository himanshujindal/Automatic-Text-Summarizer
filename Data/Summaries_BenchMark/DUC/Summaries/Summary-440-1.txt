South Africa's drought could adversely affect grain production and
cancel out the expected recovery in economic growth, according to the
country's agricultural minister. He predicted earlier that hot and dry
conditions in southern Africa could cause widespread famine.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture organization said that the
expected shortfall would be four million tons.

Of the countries facing famine, Mozambique and Zambia, in addition to 
Zimbabwe and South Africa, were the most in danger. 

The countries facing famine do not have adequate rail and port
facilities, complicating the distribution of food to needed areas.
