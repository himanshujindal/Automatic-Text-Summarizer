The 1988 blazes at Yellowstone have flamed out but the controversy
they kindled is still smoldering.  It is sure to leave its mark on
future fire and management policies throughout the vast system of
national parks and wilderness areas.  Arguments still rage over the
impact of fires on wildlife, the conduct of officials responsible for
monitoring the blazes, and the role of the media in creating an
erroneous impression that a national treasure had been somehow reduced
to cinders.  In response, the Interior Department, parent of the
National Park Service, has already ordered a summer-long moratorium on
its politically sensitive "let-burn" policy.
