The Egyptian government said Iraqi agents or Egyptian Moslem
fundamentalists were to blame for the assassination in October 1990 of
its second highest official, Rifaat el- Mahgoub.  He is the first
Egyptian politician assassinated since Islamic extremists shot
President Anwar Sadat nine years ago.  Four assassins riding two
motorbikes killed el- Mahgoub in a car.  The death toll from the
attack rose to six with the death of his chauffeur.

Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Mirissa had warned days earlier of such
an attack.  He said authorities arrested alleged saboteurs who were
entering the country with orders from Iraqi President Saddem Hussein
to assassinate Egyptian officials.
