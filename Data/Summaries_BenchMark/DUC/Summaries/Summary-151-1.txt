Canadian coach Charlie Francis who claimed that Ben Johnson's urine
sample at the Olympics was spiked with a banned substance worried that
Johnson might test positive.  Lynda Huey a physical therapist at the
Olympics said that Francis told her that Johnson was more afraid of
failing the drug test than he was of Carl Lewis.  Francis said that
Johnson was not taking the steroid stanozolol before the games and was
clean at the Olympics but Huey said that Francis must have had some
reason to think that Johnson might not pass the test.
