Over the past two years the Ventura district attorney's office in four
separate incidents has declined to prosecute suspects who contended
that they were victims of police brutality while being arrested by
Oxnard officers. In a fifth case an Oxnard man who says he and others
at a private party were beaten by Oxnard police, was prosecuted on
misdemeanor charges of resisting arrest rather than assaulting an
officer as charged by the arresting officer. The men involved in three
of the five incidents have filed police brutality lawsuits. In every
case it is alleged that officers beat or severely manhandled the
victim without provocation.
