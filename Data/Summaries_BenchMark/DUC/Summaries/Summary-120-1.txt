One tactic used by gun lobbyists to counter any proposed legislation
for gun control is to mobilize its forces at the grass roots level
with petitions.  Another tactic is to launch verbal attacks such as
the one against Congressman DeConcini, a former opponent of gun
control measures who had changed his views.

Leading the gun lobby charge is the National Rifle Association.  It
continues to use its interpretation of the Second Amendment to the
Constitution as the cornerstone of its opposition.  Gun crimes,
however, continue to bring more public pressure against the NRA and
for gun control legislation.
