Central American and Caribbean governments await a US statement on
Caribbean basin market protection in the US and Canada, promised by
President Clinton in talks last year.  Regional leaders fear Mexico
could capture Caribbean-developed markets and investments could be
diverted to Mexico. Also, parity for a few exports would come at the
price of investment treaties, intellectual property and workers'
rights agreements, environmental legislation, democracy, etc. A de
facto extension of NAFTA is unlikely, given the opposition to the
original NAFTA. Some US congressmen propose putting all regional
exports on a par with Mexico's for three years while future trade
relationships are negotiated.
