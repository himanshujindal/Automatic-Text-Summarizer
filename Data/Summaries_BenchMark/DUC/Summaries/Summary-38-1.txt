One of the longest total eclipses this century will pass from Hawaii
through the southern Baja California peninsula into central Brazil.
The "Period of totality" will last the longest in the town of Tuxpan
on Mexico's west coast.  Hawaii and Baja are the prime spots because
they offer the best chance of cloudless skies.  50,000 to 70,000 sun
watchers are expected at each place.  Accommodations and
transportation to these places are totally booked.  Mexican
authorities will turn back travelers in the Baja who do not have
written proof of accommodations.  Airlines may also be very
overbooked.  This could get ugly.
