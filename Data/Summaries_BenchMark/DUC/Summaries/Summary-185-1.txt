Residents of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and nearby islands were
warned to bolt down everything loose and stock up on food and water to
prepare for Hurricane Dean.  Dean was upgraded from a tropical storm
to the second hurricane of the Atlantic season.  In San Juan, shoppers
formed long lines in supermarkets and workers boarded up windows of
the governor's mansion and stores in the tourist district.
Forecasters expected the storm to hit land first in Barbuda, the
eastern most Leeward Island.  In Florida, a hurricane specialist
called Dean a small hurricane with hurricane force winds confined
within 25 miles of its center.
