The "Chunnel" between Britain and France is half dug, scheduled to
open in three years on time, but is almost 60% over budget, embroiled
in contractor dispute over responsibility for $1.7 billion in
overruns, and scrambling for more investment money after the British
government refused to finance a rail link.  The British public shows
little enthusiasm for the Chunnel, fearing it will import rabies,
terrorists and invading armies.  The French are forging ahead with a
high-speed rail link, enthusiastic because the tunnel surfaces in one
of their more depressed areas.  Rural southeast English are reluctant
to have high-speed trains screaming through their back yards.
