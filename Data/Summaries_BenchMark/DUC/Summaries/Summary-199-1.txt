The assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential
candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in
March 1994 in Tijuana, Baja California prompted expressions of
sympathy from neighboring countries.  Official condolences were sent
to the Mexican government by the President of Colombia, the ruling
party in El Salvador, and the Venezuelan Foreign Minister, all of whom
also expressed their support for Mexico.  The Cuban Foreign Ministry
expressed its shock and indignation at the incident.  Rival Mexican
candidates sent regrets noting the threat politicians face when they
appear at public rallies and that such violence was the result of
"savage capitalism."
