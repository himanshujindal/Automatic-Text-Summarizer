President Bush said that he could support an increased minimum wage
only if Congress also established a sub-minimum training wage.  Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole had told the Senate of that position the day
before.  Senator Kennedy, chairman of the committee is opposed to the
training wage.  Mrs.  Dole said that the "skills gap" could be erased
through job-training programs.  Organized labor believes that some
employers would use the lower, training wage for hiring and would lay
off higher paid workers.  Kennedy's bill would increase the wage from
$3.35 to $4.55 per hour in three annual 40 cent increases.
