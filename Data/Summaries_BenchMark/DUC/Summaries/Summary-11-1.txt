US cities along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were
on alert last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after hitting
southern Florida leaving at least eight dead, causing severe property
damage, and leaving 1.2 million homes without electricity.  Gusts of
up to 165 mph were recorded. It is the fiercest hurricane to hit the
US in decades.  As Andrew moved across the Gulf there was concern that
it might hit New Orleans, which would be particularly susceptible to
flooding, or smash into the concentrated offshore oil
facilities. President Bush authorized federal disaster assistance for
the affected areas.
