Mexico's President has appointed a Cabinet-level commission to prepare
for "the solar eclipse of the century" on July 11, 1991.  It will pass
through 14 of Mexico's 31 states.  The 165-mile-wide path will go dark
for almost seven minutes, the maximum length for a total solar
eclipse.  Most hotels along the route are already full.  Tourism
officials are seeking private homes, campgrounds, schools, auditoriums
and even ships to house the expected influx.  Some 13,500 amateur and
professional astronomers from around the world have confirmed
reservations.  Baja California Sur, due to its cloudless days, is
considered the best place to watch.
