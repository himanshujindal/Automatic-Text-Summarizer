Farmers are taking stock in Zimbabwe. They are totaling losses in the
face of the worst drought they have ever experienced. Rainfall in 1992
has been less than half the usual amount.

The production of maize, a staple crop, is about 90 percent less than
normal.  Soybeans, winter wheat and cotton production is a fraction of
the usual totals.  Only drought-resistant tobacco is at normal
levels. Farm production for 1992 has decreased to the lowest level in
30 years.

Zimbabwe needs 350 million dollars worth of imported food. Water
shortages are having a serious effect on electric power
production.
