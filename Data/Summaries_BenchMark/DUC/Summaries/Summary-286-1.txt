Twelve million Americans have diabetes but the incidence is highest in
minorities - Native Americans, Hispanics and blacks.  Hispanics are
three times as likely to develop diabetes as the general population;
40% of the 700,000 victims in Texas are Mexican-Americans.  San
Antonio (50% Hispanic) is the center of diabetes investigation, at the
University of Texas Health Center, which has attracted a team of
investigators from Yale.

Researchers are reaching out to the population by taking a mobile
home, equipped to test for the disease, out to city neighborhoods.

Ultimately they hope to locate a gene presidposing to the disease,
which might lead to a screening test.

They believe that poor hispanics' diet, lack of exercise and medical
care increases the risk.
