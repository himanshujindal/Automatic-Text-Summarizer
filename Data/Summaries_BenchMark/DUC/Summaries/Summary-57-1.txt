President Clinton states that he is committed to "ending welfare as we
know it."  He will base his reforms on the principle that welfare
should not be a way of life.  His reform will focus on better
implementation of the Family Support Act, a 1988 welfare reform based
on NGA task-force work that he, as governor of Arkansas, co-chaired.
However, with the onset of recession, states' revenues are constrained
while the number of welfare recipients has increased.  Therefore, few
states are able to implement the Act's requirements for education or
training.  Clinton will allow states to experiment with their own
reforms.
