Clinton campaigned on welfare reform.  But, as president, he is first
addressing two higher priorities: deficit reduction and healthcare
reform, both of which, he believes, will help alleviate welfare.  He
has improved the earned income tax credit and will enforce laws
requiring financial support from absentee fathers.  These measures may
help but will not solve America's welfare problems.  Many
conservatives favor a strict time limit, two years, for welfare.  Most
people consider this too drastic.  Something like an FDR public sector
works program, although probably not affordable, might work.  Many
think the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988 is the answer.
