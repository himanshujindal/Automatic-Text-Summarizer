For two months last summer, residents of the northeastern corner area
of Yellowstone National Park were threatened to be burned out by
forest fires.  Eventually, millions of dollars, thousands of
man-hours, and an early autumn snowfall saved the area.  The
unprecedented fire season burned nearly 1.5 million acres in the
greater Yellowstone ecosystem, including 705,000 acres within the
National Park, causing residents to worry about what is happening
beneath the snow this winter.  Reportedly, some wildfires have buried
themselves in roots of trees and grasses and smoldered all winter,
only to pop up through the snow in the spring.
