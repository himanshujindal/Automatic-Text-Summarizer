Officials in California's San Francisco Bay area have identified 10
local areas that seem to have the greatest potential for a firestorm.
Collectively, there are many community problems that cause
firefighters great concern: a preponderance of wood homes; shake
roofs; winding, steep or narrow roads; dense vegetation; mix of dense
homes and dry forest; weak bridges; few fire stations; longer fire
alarm response times; limited or uncertain water supply; gridlock from
fleeing residents; failure of residents to comply with fire codes.
Firefighters complain overall that moving into wooded seclusion and
natural beauty exacts a cost in fire protection.
