Because of a flood of diamonds from Angola and diamond "leaks" outside
Russia's contract with the cartel, De Beers imposed quotas on
producers and is operating its newest mine below capacity. Venetia
came into production in July 1992 at a cost of $400 million. It gives
De Beers direct control over more than 50% of the world's gem diamond
output and a powerful negotiating position within the cartel. The mine
employs fewer people than in the past because of highly automated
processing and fewer overseers. It busses in workers from their home
towns for 12-hour shifts instead of using migrant workers.
