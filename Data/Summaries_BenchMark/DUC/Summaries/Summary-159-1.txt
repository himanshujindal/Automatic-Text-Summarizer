Angella Issajenko, a Canadian Olympic sprinter, said that Ben Johnson
knowingly took steroids.  She said that Dr. Jamie Astaphan provided
the steroids with the knowledge of sprint coach Charlie Francis of the
Mazda Optimist Track to which both she and Johnson belong. Issajenko
acknowledged that she also took the steroids.  Johnson says he never
knowingly took illegal drugs and Astaphan said he has never
administered stanozolol, the banned drug found in the sprinter's urine
sample after the race.  Francis said the test result could only be
explained "by deliberate manipulation of the testing process".
