While workers fanned out across Louisiana yesterday for a massive
rebuilding effort after the destruction caused by Hurricane Andrew,
officials in Florida complained of delays in supplying critical
assistance to thousands of people in need. Transportation Secretary
Andrew Card promised "dramatic" improvements.  In Dade County Florida
it was reported that the hurricane had wiped out the homes of one
resident in eight, affecting a quarter of a million people. The
government estimated that it would cost $20-30 billion to rebuild and
care for displaced residents in Florida.  The Federal Emergency
Management Agency said it was setting aside $77 million to help
Louisiana recover.
