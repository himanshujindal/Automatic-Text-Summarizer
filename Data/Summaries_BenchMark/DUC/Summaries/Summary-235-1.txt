President Clinton chose William Daley, son of legendary Chicago
political boss Richard Daley, to head a task force to get NAFTA
ratified. Smooth-talking Daley has important connections in Washington
and long-standing ties with organized labor. He is experienced at the
back-room political arm-twisting required to sway moderate Democrats
in a divided Congress. Recent polls show 2/3 of Americans oppose
NAFTA.  Grassroots opposition fueled by labor groups is
growing. Clinton reserved his own support until environmental and
labor side agreements were reached. The agreement will unravel if it
is not ratified by Jan 1. The battle for congressional support will be
fierce.
