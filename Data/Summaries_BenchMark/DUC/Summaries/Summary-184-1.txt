Super computers, satellites, and forecaster expertise predicted the
destructive path of Hurricane Hugo allowing people time to flee the
South Carolina coast.  The real forecasting problem with Hugo was
predicting its intensity which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane
just before it slammed into Charleston.  Forecasters analyze super
computer predictions, satellite data, history of similar storms, and
the current path of the hurricane to determine its track; then they
make an educated guess.  The accuracy of satellite pictures is
improving each year so long range forecasting should become more
precise.
