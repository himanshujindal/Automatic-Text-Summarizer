Little relief is predicted for areas plagued by the drought, which is
moving eastward.  Now 29% of the nation is undergoing severe or
extreme drought conditions, accompanied by above normal temperatures
in much of the nation.  The drought involves the northern Great
Plains, Rocky Mountains, the Great Lakes region, and the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys, and may extend into the Mid-Atlantic states.
Nationally the drought is about equal to the one in 1911 and somewhat
less severe than those in 1956 or several years in the 1930's.
However, large areas of the Midwest have had the driest April-June
since 1895.
