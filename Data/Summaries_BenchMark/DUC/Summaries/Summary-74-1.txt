A United States Air Force B-52 bomber, assigned to the Strategic Air
Command and based at K.I. Sawyer Airfield in Michigan, crashed today
at 1:15 A.M. while practicing "touch-and-go" landings at its base.
The aircraft burst into flames.  None of the crew was burned, but all
suffered injuries, with one in critical condition. In recent B-52
crashes, two crewmembers were killed when their aircraft clipped a
mesa in Arizona, and on February 14th of this year there were no
injuries when a pilot overshot a runway in California.
