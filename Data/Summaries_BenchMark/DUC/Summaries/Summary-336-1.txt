Thirty-nine nations are meeting in Paris to determine the fate of
Antarctica.  They will review the 1959 Antarctica treaty that expires
in 1991, but more importantly, the 1988 Antarctica Minerals Convention
that would have allowed controlled mining and oil exploration there.
The Convention was not ratified by Australia, one of seven claimant
nations with veto power.  None holds title; sixteen nations fly flags
there.

Antarctica hoards unknown quantities of strategic metals along with
oil estimated to be in the billions of gallons.  Many nations are
pressing for controlled exploitation of the continent, others argue
for it to remain unspoiled.
