Ben Johnson spent his homecoming without the gold medal and hero's
welcome.  On the flight from Seoul to New York he denied using drugs
even though Olympic officials said the test results were indisputable.
On his flight from New York to Canada, he spent the entire time in the
cockpit to avoid reporters.  A parade in his adopted home town in
Canada was canceled and promoters backed out of deals with the
sprinter.  Johnson's family and friends denied that he took steroids.
Johnson's fans were disappointed but hundreds of Canadians rallied to
the sprinter's side.
