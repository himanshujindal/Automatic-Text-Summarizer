The official opening of the Channel tunnel this year promises to help
revitalize the northwest regions of Belgium although the country's
biggest ports will suffer a loss in traffic.  Flanders, the area most
likely to benefit, has suffered rapid increases in unemployment.  Two
main areas for development are: firstly, increasing traffic as holiday
makers and freight carriers head towards the tunnel opening in Calais
and, secondly, tourism.  West Flanders is home to some of the
best-known World War 1 battlefields and large, open green spaces.  The
biggest advantage is the close cooperation between national and
federal authorities with French and UK counterparts.
