A United States Air Force C-5 transport crashed early Wednesday as it
left Ramstein Air Base in Germany, a stopover point for the huge
aircraft that was carrying medical supplies and equipment destined for
American forces in Saudi Arabia.  The plane was assigned to the 60th
Military Airlift Squadron in California.  Nine of the 13 killed were
reservists who had volunteered to help in the military buildup in the
Persian Gulf.  The C-5 is the largest transport in the inventory, and
Wednesday's crash was the first C-5 to go down since one crashed in
April 1975, killing 172 people.
