The New York City Health Commissioner said that the number of active
cases of tuberculosis in the city in 1990 totaled 3,520, an increase
of 38 percent over 1989. The Department said that it was instituting
new cure programs, and taking measures to improve tuberculosis
prevention programs. Children must be tested before entering school,
and homeless centers and substance-abuse centers are getting special
attention.  The greatest concentration of new cases was in the 25-44
age group. The number of men in the caseload was twice that the number
of women.
