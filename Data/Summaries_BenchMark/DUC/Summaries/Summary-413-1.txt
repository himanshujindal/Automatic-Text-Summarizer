Fire broke out aboard a Soviet passenger liner carrying French
tourists on a cruise of the Mediterranean, but the crew put out the
blaze and no passengers were injured, Tass reported Monday.

The ship docked at the Maltese port of Valletta and the tourists were
expected to continue their voyage on another Soviet ship.

This was the second fire aboard a Soviet cruise ship in recent months.
On May 18, a blaze broke out on Priamurye while it was in the Japanese
port of Osaka.  Eleven Soviets were killed in that fire and 26 others
were hospitalized in critical condition, Tass reported.
