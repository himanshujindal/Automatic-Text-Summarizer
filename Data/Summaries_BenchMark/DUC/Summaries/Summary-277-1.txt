Ross Baker equates term limits to burning down the house to get rid of
the rats.  He believe the recurring temptation to legislate vengeance
on adversaries will backfire.  Oklahoma has limited state lawmakers to
12 years' service.  This will create more amateurs who will be
controlled by governors and bureaucrats and more vulnerable to
corruption.  Additionally, office holders will not have a stake in
their job and will be more concerned with their next job.  Lobbyists
and legislative staffs will be celebrating the guaranteed influx of
inexperienced office holders.  Baker considers term limits illogical
and wrong, and an insult to the voters.
