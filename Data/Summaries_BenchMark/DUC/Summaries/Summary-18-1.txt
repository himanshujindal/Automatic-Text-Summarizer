The Long Beach City Council has called for an investigation of an
incident broadcast on NBC's national news Monday night. A white
policeman, Dickey, was filmed pushing an off-duty black policeman,
Jackson, through a plate glass window. Jackson and a companion were
driving through a high-crime area of Long Beach when they were pulled
over by Dickey. Dickey started to search Jackson and when Jackson
asked why he was being searched, Dickey unleashed a stream of
profanity and ordered Jackson to put his hands behind his head. When
Jackson complied he was pushed through a plate-glass store
window.
