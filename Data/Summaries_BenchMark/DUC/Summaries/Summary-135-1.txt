Marathon runner Alphonce Swai is continuing his comeback bid by
entering the upcoming America's Finest City HomeFed Half Marathon.
Swai, who ran in the 1984 Olympics for Tanzania is a recovering
alcoholic.

Swai began his comeback by entering the Trib10k race but finished a
poor 16th.  He has won two races since then, the Coronado Half
Marathon and the Goodwill Games 10k run in Seattle.  He was able to
achieve victory in the Goodwill Games despite his taking a wrong turn.

Swai believes the upcoming race will be a difficult one in that the
runner who paces himself will win.
