Botswana's contract with De Beers, which controls 80% of the world
diamond market, has expired and Botswana wants to partly sell
independently. It is the only major diamond producer currently selling
total production to De Beers, who argues independent selling would
compromise the cartel's ability to preserve an orderly market. IDC, an
independent who markets diamonds for four countries, refutes this and
argues Botswana doesn't know the real value of its diamonds, which
represent half De Beers' profits.  Botswana faces a budget deficit.
In 1987 it sold its diamond stockpile to De Beers for $250 million and
a 5.27% share.
