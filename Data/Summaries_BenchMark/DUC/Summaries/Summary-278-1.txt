T.K. Wetherel does not believe that the Federalists Alexander Hamilton
and James Madison supported term limits.  Limits were included in the
failed Articles of Confederation and rejected by the Constitutional
Convention and the First Congress.  Hamilton reasoned term limitations
on the presidency would diminish the inducements to good behavior.
Madison wrote that members of Congress in long-standing could become
masters of the public business.  Not the Federalists, but the
out-of-power opposition wanted limits.  With term limits, key
legislation, such as the 1850 Compromise and civil- rights bills, may
not have been enacted and Medicare and Social Security may not have
been protected.
