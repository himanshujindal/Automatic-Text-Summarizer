The author of an article in the Wall Street Journal believes that
opponents of gun control write passionately but do not read well.

He forms this opinion from some "Letters to the Editor" he received in
response to his article recommending sensible gun control.  One letter
writer accuses him of wanting to remove all guns from American
citizens through total regulation.  The author vigorously denies
making any such statement.  Other writers accuse him of distorting the
Second Amendment on the "..right to keep and bear arms."

The author simply maintains that the Amendment is not a barrier to gun
control.
