March 7, 1989, Dateline: Pasadena, California.  A partial solar
eclipse was visible today across much of western North America.
Dozens of people watched it through two types of solar telescopes at
the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.  Scientists warn
against staring at the sun directly or through inadequate filters.
During this event the greatest blockage of the sun, 80%, occurred in
Anchorage, Alaska.  For any single spot on earth, a partial eclipse
occurs every several years.  Total solar eclipses at any single
location occur roughly every four centuries, though they are visible
from somewhere on earth about every two years.
