There is an extensive history of drought and famine in Africa and it
is continuing. Twenty-seven million people are now facing famine.

Millions have died. Some governments have refused relief supplies for
portions of their countries under rebel control, thus increasing
famine deaths.

U.S. donations to Africa run into the millions. Because of the
enormity of the problem, donor countries have difficulty in keeping up
with requests.

The U.S. is debating about attaching strings to aid. Military forces
in Africa have seized some food supplies for themselves and these
forces keep the governments in power.
