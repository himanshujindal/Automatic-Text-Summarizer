Lebanese newspapers published birthday letters to American journalist
Terry Anderson on Saturday.  One newspaper reported that fellow
hostage Terry Waite will be freed soon.

Seven newspapers printed birthday greetings to Anderson from his
sister, Peggy Say, his youngest daughter, Sulome, and Madeleine,
Sulome's mother.  They published the original English text so that
Anderson, who did not know Arabic when he was kidnapped, would be able
to read them if his kidnapers allowed him to.

The newspaper, ad-Diyar, meanwhile, said British hostage Terry Waite
would be freed either "by the end of this month or within the first
half of the coming November, at the latest."
