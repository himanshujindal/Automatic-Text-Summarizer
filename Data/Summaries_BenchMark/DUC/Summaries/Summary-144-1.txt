Lewis Preston, World Bank president, vowed to strengthen the bank's
efforts at poverty reduction. He failed to respond to demands from the
U. S. to set goals for poverty reduction. Of concern to the U.S. was
the need to create economic safety nets for the poor affected by wars,
economic hardship and civil strife.

The World Bank currently lends only 14 percent of its loans for human
resource development in spite of a call from its president for greater
emphasis on helping the poor. He declined to set specific targets.

The bank intends to publish annual reports on the bank's
progress.
