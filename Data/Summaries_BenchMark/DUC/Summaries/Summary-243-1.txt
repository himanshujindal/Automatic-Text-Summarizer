The Slovenian government banned a pro-Serbian rally in Lubljana on
Friday, calling it organized by Serbian politicians trying to oust the
Slovenian leadership, including Yugoslav President Janez Drnovsek, a
Slovene.  Serbia reacted by severing political and economic contacts
with Slovenia. The Slovenian government called the Serbian economic
boycott an attempt to oust Slovenia from Yugoslavia, which it would
never permit. 100 people gathered on Friday and 13 were
arrested. Economic decline has increased friction between Slovenia,
which advocates regional autonomy and legalized opposition groups, and
the communist leadership of Serbia, which insists on a centralized
federation with the Communist Party the only official party.
