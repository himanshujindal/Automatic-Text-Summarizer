Coast Guard Commandant Yost attacked Exxon's plan to clean up the
Alaskan oil spill.  Also, consumer activist Ralph Nader, other
environmentalists, and politicians expressed anger in a one day
"Boycott Exxon" campaign.  The cleanup is to be paid for by the oil
industry and could add $100-500M to Alaska's economy, more than
offsetting the loss to the fishing industry.  Thousands of dead birds
were spotted 300 miles from the spill site.  Since the Exxon Valdez
spill, gas prices have increased 10% nationally and as much as 25% in
the Northwest.  Nebraska's two senators have asked the US Attorney
General to investigate possible price gouging by the oil
industry.
