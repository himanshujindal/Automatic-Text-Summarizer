A Boeing 737 jetliner on a flight from London to Belfast crashed
during an emergency landing at East Midlands Airport.  The pilot had
radioed that the right engine was on fire, then called again to say
that he had shut the engine down and was coming in for a landing.
Actually the left engine had burned and the pilot had shut down the
wrong engine.  The crash killed 49 people and injured 82.  The pilot,
seriously hurt, was being questioned by investigators.

Authorities are ordering checks on similar engines on other aircraft,
including the possibility of crossed wires on warning systems.
