Barber Conable was a very respected New York politician prior to being
appointed World Bank president. He is now under fire. Criticism
centers on his bank's inability to reduce the burgeoning Third World
debt.

Some worry that the huge Third World debt will stall growth and thence
create instability.

The bank has followed the conservative fiscal policies of the man who
appointed Conable to his office, Secretary of the Treasury James
Baker. His policy is the one of lending new money rather than reducing
the debt but this often ends up swamping the recipient countries with
interest payments.
