 
It is estimated that 275,000 people are without electricity and at
least 150,000 are either homeless or living among ruins as a result of
Hurricane Andrew which ripped through southern Florida last
week. President Bush yesterday made his second visit to the region
since the hurricane hit. He pledged the government would see through
the clean-up "until the job is done." US insurers expect to pay out
$7.3 billion in Florida making Hurricane Andrew by far the costliest
disaster the industry has ever faced. This estimate does not include
any projection for claims in Louisiana, so the final cost will be
higher still.
