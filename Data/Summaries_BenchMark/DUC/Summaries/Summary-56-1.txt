A House-Senate conference committee has before it two welfare reform
bills --- the Senate-passed bill containing a work requirement, the
House-approved measure without.  President Reagan stated that
unemployment was near a 14-year low.  He would veto any welfare
legislation not containing a work requirement.

Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., states that 32.5 million Americans
remain mired in poverty.  He feels that state and local, not federal,
welfare officials should control any welfare work requirement.  He
believes that the House bill, with training and education programs,
and health and child-care benefits, would make welfare parents who
work better off than those who don't.
