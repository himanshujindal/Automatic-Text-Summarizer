According to a recent Gallup poll, 70% of the members of the House of
Representatives oppose limiting the number of congressional terms,
while almost two- thirds of the public support the idea.  Franking
privileges and campaign finance laws make defeating an incumbent very
difficult, with 96% of incumbents re-elected over the past three
elections.  Also, one in four incumbents this year will have no major
party opposition.  This trend is spreading to the Senate.  Since
presidents are limited to two terms, political power has shifted to
the legislature.  Congressional careerism has become the norm, and
some want a constitutional amendment to limit terms.
