Alaska Gov Cowper threatened to close down the trans-Alaska pipeline
unless owners met measures for improved safety and clean-up, namely:
description of dedicated clean-up gear, names of 12 response teams
available 24 hours a day, installation of containment booms around
tankers in harbor, restrict tanker traffic to daylight, limit to
loading one tanker at a time until all equipment in place, and show
that adequate gear and supplies are available to handle another 10M
gallon spill.  Former Exxon Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood left jail
in New York after a judge cut his bail from $500,000 to $25,000.
