The Exxon Valdez was illegally piloted by its third mate, who didn't
have a proper pilot's license, when the vessel ran aground.  Exxon
said the captain, Joseph Hazelwood, was not on the bridge at the time
of the the accident, contrary to company policy.  The captain and two
crew members were relieved of duty and subpoenaed by the NSTB.  Two
supertankers remained anchored offshore by the closure of the Valdez
port.  Alaska's governor declared the pristine Prince William Sound a
disaster area.  The Coast Guard estimated the spill as covering 100
square miles.  Many fishermen expected minimal harvests and long term
damage to its reputation.
