As the November 17 House vote on NAFTA approaches, the White House is
summoning undecided congressmen, business leaders and journalists for
intimate briefings in order to sway their votes. To win the votes of 8
Hispanic congressmen, Clinton will soon announce support for a North
American Development Bank to fund projects in communities hit by job
losses resulting from NAFTA. Cabinet members are traveling to
congressional districts to publicize factories expected to gain jobs
under NAFTA. Clinton spoke at an exhibit of products likely to
benefit, while the AFL-CIO presented speakers who lost their jobs when
their employers moved to Mexico.
