A federal judge has sentenced Michael Milken to 10 years in prison and
three years on probation during which he must perform full-time
community service. When the judge read the sentence Milken stood rigid
and motionless with a look of disbelief. The sentence was by far the
harshest imposed in the recent chain of Wall Street scandals. Milken
pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, filing false
information with the SEC, mail fraud and aiding in the filing of a
false tax return. The judge said she was convinced by evidence
presented in pre-sentencing that Milken had committed other serious
crimes including obstruction of justice.
