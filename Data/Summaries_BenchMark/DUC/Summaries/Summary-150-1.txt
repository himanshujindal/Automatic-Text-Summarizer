Carl Lewis said he knew that Ben Johnson was taking
performance-enhancing drugs after their 100-meter final at the Seoul
Olympics.  Lewis believed that after all the preliminary heats that
Johnson would not have been able to perform as he did without taking
something.  Now Lewis has been implicated in an alleged sabotage of
Johnson's drug test.  A Canadian coach said that Johnson might have
drunk contaminated beer, given to aid in urinalysis, just before the
test.  Supposedly, an unidentified man who sat near the beer talked
with Lewis.  Lewis' attorney said the charge was ludicrous.  Johnson
had earlier taken drugs to induce growth of muscle tissue.
