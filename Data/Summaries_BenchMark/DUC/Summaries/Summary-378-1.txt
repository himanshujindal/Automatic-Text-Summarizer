The Defense Facility Administration Agency hires Japanese workers at
United States bases, and acts as liaison between the Japanese
government and the United States military. Since September 1987 the
Navy has been telling employees that they would be required to take
polygraph tests before getting "limited access authorization". Last
month the Navy explained the requirement, and the workers are now
protesting it as an invasion of their privacy. The Navy is threatening
to transfer those who refuse the polygraph, and the Japanese Garrison
Forces Union that represents the workers, say they will mount a
nation-wide protest.
