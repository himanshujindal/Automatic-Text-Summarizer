The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season begins amid warnings that the last
two years may have been harbingers of a new era of destructive storms.
A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report notes
that the coastal areas from Maine to Texas will experience a 60%
growth in population and are ill prepared to handle a hurricane
emergency.  Predictions of increased hurricane activity are based on
studies, atmospheric low pressure waves, and increased rainfall trends
in West Africa near the breeding grounds for most hurricanes.  There
are five categories of hurricanes: Category 1 has sustained winds from
74-95 mph; Category 5 has top winds greater than 155 mph.
