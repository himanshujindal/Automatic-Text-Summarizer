Scientists have found a hormone that may lead to new treatments for
Type II diabetes.  News of the hormone, Amylin, was reported by
Dr. Garth Cooper of New Zealand to the International Diabetes
Federation.

Researchers believe that amylin, found in high levels in the diabetic
pancreas, appears to be responsible for the obesity and lower insulin
secretion and effectiveness found in Type II diabetics.  Obesity is
currently thought of as a cause, not an effect of, diabetes.

Insulin normally controls blood sugar; in type II diabetes it becomes
ineffective and blood sugar rises.  Complications include kidney
disease, blindness, and gangrene of the extremities.

Researchers hope to develop substances that block amylin's
action.
