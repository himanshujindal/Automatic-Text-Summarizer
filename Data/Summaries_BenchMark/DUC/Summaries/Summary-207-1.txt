Workman tunneling under the English Channel Tuesday created the first
land link between Britain and France when British workers sent a
two-inch wide probe through to their French colleagues.  The tunnel
symbolizes the growing unification of Europe.  Despite her
countrymen's fears of losing their ancient moat against Europe,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said, "This is what Europe is
about."

The link-up was on time despite a pay strike by militant French
workers and two serious injuries.  France hopes the project will
revitalize depressed northern regions.  Many Britons fear an influx of
Continental ills ranging from terrorists to rabid animals.
