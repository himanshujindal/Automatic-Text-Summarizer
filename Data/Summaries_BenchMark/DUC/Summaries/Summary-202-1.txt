Construction of a 31-mile tunnel, 24 miles of it underwater, is
underway between Dover, England to the coast of France.  Scheduled to
be completed in 1993, it will cut the London-Paris journey from six
hours to three.  It will enable freight to travel on a single train
instead of being transferred to trucks for a ferry trip.  Some wonder
whether Britain will be ready for it.  A writer on the project said,
"They're still arguing about whether it will introduce rabies into
this country, or let in terrorists."  Critics say obsolete commuter
lines in SE England will cause delays.
