As of 1990, about 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are being reported
annually, resulting in 1,700 deaths. Blacks are six times more likely
to have tuberculosis than are whites.  The disparity has long been
attributed to crowded housing and other conditions of poverty. A
recently published study concluded that blacks are innately more
susceptible to the disease, and that when living conditions were
comparable blacks were only twice as likely to contract the
disease. Specialists in the area were intrigued and impressed by the
study, but not all were willing to agree that biology, and not social
factors, was the major factor.
