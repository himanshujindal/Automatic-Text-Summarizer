Lieutenant Zanti intends to match the efforts of his wife and father
who are running in the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington.  The naval
officer is planning on running on the battleship WISCONSIN.

Zanti had been stationed in the Mediterranean and planned on training
on land and on the ship.  Because of the ship's deployment to the
Persian Gulf, these plans were canceled.

The WISCONSIN is 887 feet long or about 1/6 of a mile.  Zanti will
have to do about 75 laps to equal 26.2 miles.

Zanti became interested in marathon running while watching his father
in California marathons.
