Gilbert became the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western
Hemisphere in terms of barometric pressure when a low of 26.13 was
recorded.  Bob Sheets, who became Director of the National Hurricane
Center in March, 1987, said that he had flown into hurricanes 200
times and it is not difficult.  Gilbert became a Category 5 storm when
its winds reached 175 mph.  Gilbert has been compared to the Labor Day
hurricane in 1935 that killed 408 people in Florida, and to Hurricane
Camille in 1969 which killed 256.  The last major hurricane to make
landfall was Elena in 1985, along the Mississippi, Alabama and Florida
Panhandle.
