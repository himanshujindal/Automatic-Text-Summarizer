Calm waters of Prince William Sound stymied efforts to disperse the
largest oil spill in US history.  The spill of 11.3M gallons occurred
when the Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef 25 miles from Valdez, Alaska.
Exxon officials planned to pump oil remaining on the Valdez onto
another Exxon tanker.  A spill of this size in a complex environment
promises to be a cleanup nightmare.  The Valdez had been loaded at the
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.  with crude from the Trans-Alaska
pipeline.  Alyeska must now operate at reduced rate and its capacity
would allow nine days of operation before it would shut down.  Valdez
relies on fishing, oil, and tourism.
