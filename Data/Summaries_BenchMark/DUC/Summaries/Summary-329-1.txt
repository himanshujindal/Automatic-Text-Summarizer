Embattled Chief of Staff John Sununu might consider the case of
another former Governor of New Hampshire who held the same White House
job. Sherman Adams was described as "laconic, abrupt, businesslike and
puritanically honest." But in the spring of 1958 it came to light that
Adams had accepted gifts from an unsavory New England industrialist
and had interceded with regulatory agencies on the industrialist's
behalf. When it became clear that Adams was becoming an issue that
could help the Democrats in the elections that fall, Eisenhower sent
Vice President Nixon and the Republican National Chairman to visit
Adams. In late September Adams resigned.
