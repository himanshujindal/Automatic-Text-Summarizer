The De Beers diamond cartel faces declining sales because of slowing
economies, high interest rates and price increases. Also, newly
energized black majorities are pressuring it to give producers better
terms. South Africa's major sources of wealth may be nationalized and
Namibia may demand a one-fifth stake in De Beers' local subsidiary. To
limit risk, De Beers is moving half its interests to Switzerland. De
Beers was formed in 1888 by British colonialist Cecil Rhodes. Diamond
merchant Ernest Oppenheimer became board chairman in 1929 and formed
the cartel, led after him by his son Harry who made the company more
international and less vulnerable.
