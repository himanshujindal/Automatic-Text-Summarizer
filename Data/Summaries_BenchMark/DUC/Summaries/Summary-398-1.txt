On March 16, 1985, Terry Anderson, chief Middle East Correspondent of
the Associated Press was abducted in Beirut, Lebanon.  The Islamic
Jihad claimed responsibility for the kidnapping in their "continuing
operations against America and its agents."

On November 8, 1985, Anderson writes an open letter to President
Reagan and his family.

Anderson begins his fourth year in captivity on March 16, 1988.  He
turned 41 on October 27.  Four days later, the Islamic Jihad issues
videotape to mark his birthday.  On the tape Anderson said he finds
"it difficult to keep my hope and courage high."
