As his final act, John Sununu, the man hired by George Bush to be his
political hatchet man, took a swipe at the boss insinuating that he
was fired for doing what he was hired to do.  Over the past three
years many have speculated that Bush was keeping his rude and
contentious chief of staff only out of loyalty to Sununu for helping
him win the 1988 New Hampshire primary. Sununu alienated Congress,
Cabinet members, House Republican and the press. But, most important,
the president's wife Barbara, and oldest son, George, turned on
Sununu. And so, finally, Bush invited Sununu to resign.
