Following a 1990 embargo by Serbia, Slovenian exports to the former
Yugoslavia fell by 85%. Slovene officials say for capital inflows to
increase Slovenia must re-establish those trade links, which accounted
for 30% of Slovene exports. Slovenia is too small to attract large
amounts of foreign investment to foster growth. It recently signed
trade agreements with Croatia and Macedonia and is seeking new markets
among EC countries. Slovenian industrial production sharply dropped
and unemployment rose to 11%, but inflation fell to 5% thanks to the
Slovene central bank's strong monetary policy. Enterprises will need
to become more competitive after privatization, now being discussed by
Parliament.
