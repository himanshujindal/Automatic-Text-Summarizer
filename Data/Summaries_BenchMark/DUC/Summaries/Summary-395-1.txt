Captain Will C. Rogers was awarded the Legion of Merit as he gave up
command of the Vincennes in a ceremony aboard the ship. Rogers has
been reassigned to shore duty at Point Loma Tactical Development and
Training Group. Unusually tight security restrictions were in force
for the ceremony. The Rogerses have been under the constant protection
of the Naval Service Investigative Service since March when a
suspected terrorist bomb destroyed her van. The letter that
accompanied the award made no mention of the action in July 1988 when
Rogers ordered the shootdown of an Iranian civil airliner.
