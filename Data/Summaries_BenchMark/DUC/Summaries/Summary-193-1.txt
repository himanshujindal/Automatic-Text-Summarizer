Suspected communist rebels on 4 July 1989 killed Col. Herminio Taylo,
police chief of Makati, the Philippines major financial center, in an
escalation of street violence sweeping the Capitol area.  The gunmen
shouted references to the rebel New People's Army.  They fled in a
commandeered passenger jeep.  The military says communist rebels have
killed up to 65 soldiers and police in the Capitol region since
January.  The New People's Army also claimed responsibility for the
April 21 assassination of a US Army colonel on his way to work at the
Joint Military Assistance Group headquarters in suburban Quezon
City.
