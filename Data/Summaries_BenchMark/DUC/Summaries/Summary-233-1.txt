The US Hispanic community is deeply divided on NAFTA. Important US
Hispanic coalitions like the civil rights group La Raza and the
Southwest Voter Registration Project fear US Hispanics would bear most
of NAFTA's negative impact. Sectors of the US economy most vulnerable
to import penetration are those most dependent on recent immigration
for their labor. The groups are making stringent side agreements
protecting worker rights and the environment a condition of their
support, demanding retraining of displaced workers and proposing a
trilateral Development Bank to direct resources to negatively affected
regions. Hispanic business organizations enthusiastically back NAFTA
and fear side agreements could jeopardize it.
