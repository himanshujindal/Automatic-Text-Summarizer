Charles Keating was a shrewd observer of people, especially people who
could help him in building and protecting his financial
empire. Keating's political beliefs were not a consideration when
seeking political influence.

This became evident during the course of Keating's battles against
officials who were attempting to put restrictions on the savings and
loan industry.

On one occasion, Keating used the influence he had as a heavy
contributor to arrange a meeting with five senators, four of whom were
Democrats and one a Republican. Keating, a conservative Republican,
had little in common with the four Democrats in the group.
