The National Hurricane Center study said that the US death toll from a
major hurricane could be far worse than previously predicted as they
marked the opening of the 1988 storm season.  The first tropical
depression of the year has formed just south of Cuba but is not
expected to strengthen.  A hurricane specialist said that the
Geo-Stationary Earth-Orbiting Environmental Satellite that covers part
of the Western Hemisphere may stop working making it necessary to
redirect GOES-East in order to monitor the hurricane-spawning area.
In 1987, there were only three hurricanes, Emily, Arlene, and Floyd,
and four tropical storms in the Atlantic.
