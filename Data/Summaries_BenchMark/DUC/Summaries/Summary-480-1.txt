The House passed a minimum wage bill that exceeded the amount which
President Bush said he would veto.  The House asked the president to
refrain from veto threats until after the Senate acts.  Senator
Kennedy sponsored a bill that would raise the minimum to $4.65 by 1992
but is open to amending his bill and has asked the President to keep
an open mind until the House and Senate agree.  The House bill would
boost the wage to $4.55 by 1991 and would have a new hire wage pegged
at 85% of the minimum.  It also contained several exemptions for small
business.
