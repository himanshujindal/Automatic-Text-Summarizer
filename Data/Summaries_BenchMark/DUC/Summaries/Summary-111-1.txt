Elizabeth has rallied from a near fatal bout with pneumonia but is
"not out of the woods," doctors say.

"I believe her life was in jeopardy over the weekend and I believe
that has now passed said Dr. Bernard Weintraub of St. Johns Hospital
and Health Center.

The actress was taken off the ventilator that had aided her breathing
for several days and is smiling again said Dr. Patricia Murray, an
infectious disease specialist.

About 80 reporters and camera crew members, along with about 100
hospital employees were on hand to hear the latest report on Miss
Taylor.
