Will the smashing allied victory in Kuwait lead to stability in the
area?  A first order of business is to stabilize the Iraqi-Kuwaiti
border and bring U.S. forces home.  However, major regional political
problems may surface.  There is the Palestinian issue.  Jordan's King
Hussein and Yasser Arafat's open sympathy for Iraq has strained their
relations with the U.S.  The biggest wild-card may be Iran.
Anti-Western sentiment could vent itself through Islamic
fundamentalism, a potential problem for Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
Some believe Iran might clash with Saudi Arabia over oil policy and
also attempt to establish an Islamic state in Iraq.
