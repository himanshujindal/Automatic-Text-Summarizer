South Africa's De Beers Consolidated Mines, which controls 80% of the
world diamond market through its London-based Central Selling
Organization, is raising its diamond prices an average 10%. Rough
diamonds were already trading at a premium over De Beers' own quotes
on the open market, especially in the Far East. In Japan, the second
biggest diamond-jewelry market after the US, appreciation of the yen
reduced diamonds' cost. Per-carat prices of D-flawless diamonds have
risen to $14,800 from $12,000 since the beginning of the year. De
Beers revived diamond trade from an early-80s slump through an
aggressive marketing campaign and withholding stocks.
