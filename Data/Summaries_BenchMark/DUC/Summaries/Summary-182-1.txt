At the opening of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season, forecasters hope
for new technological help critical to growing coastal populations.
The Air Force is phasing out hurricane reconnaissance flights,
agreeing to only two more years.  Only one satellite is now available
for tracking hurricanes.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration has been approached to take over the flights. New
satellites are not expected until late 1990.  Forecaster Hal Gerrish
said that "now we can see past the Antilles into the Atlantic and over
toward Hawaii on the west," but he would like to be able to see all
the way to Africa where Atlantic hurricanes develop.
