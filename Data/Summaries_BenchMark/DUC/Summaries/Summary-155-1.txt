Two years after his suspension for drug use at the Seoul Olympics,
sprinter Ben Johnson appeared before the press.  He was confident,
bragging, and promising big things to come.  If he returns to the
sport as a winner, all is forgiven said the assistant meet director
for the Hamilton Games.  Johnson expressed little doubt that he could
retain his 1988 form.  Johnson has passed four drug tests since his
suspension and has a new coach.  The Canadian Olympic Association is
expected to lift his ban.  Johnson will command high appearance fees
($60,000 in Stockholm) initially but later will be dependent on
performance.
