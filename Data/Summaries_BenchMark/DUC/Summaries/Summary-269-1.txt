A Sunday television program stated that according to a "very reliable
source," talks are being held between Shining Path leader Abimael
Guzman and government representatives to negotiate an agreement.  The
10-point agreement reportedly is aimed to stop the popular war
characterized by terrorism, murders, sabotage and armed agitation and
propaganda.  The agreement would also dismantle the People's Guerrilla
Army, allow a gradual general amnesty, allow exiled members to return
to Peru, and restore movement archives seized earlier. The agreement
also reportedly mentions the need for economic support in the war torn
areas.  Government officials have not commented.
