The cruise ship Song of America was forced to return to port after an
engine seized up and started a small fire, but no one was hurt.

The ship left Miami on Sunday with about 1,300 passengers on a
Caribbean cruise.  Rick Steck, a spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruise
Line said the fire was quickly doused by crewmembers.  The passengers,
who had been brought on deck, were allowed to resume the evening's
activities.

The 705-foot ship turned around and returned to Cozumel on its
remaining three engines to replenish firefighting supplies. The
passengers stayed aboard, and the ship will return to Miami on
Thursday or Friday.
