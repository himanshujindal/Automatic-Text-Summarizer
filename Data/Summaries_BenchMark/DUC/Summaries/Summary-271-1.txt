The Shining Path Central Committee, comprised of leaders who have not
been arrested, held a meeting in February presided over by
"Feliciano."  Reportedly they decided to continue the "people's war"
and reject members advocating the peace accord.  A five-point document
reasserted the violence rising from a 1992 agreement, emphasized a
1993 position supporting political and military continuation of the
people's war including in cities, and condemned members seeking peace
as "the Black Group."  The leaders claim a man in prison (Guzman)
cannot lead a communist organization, but hope to retain Guzman's
ideological principles and popular support to resume fighting.
