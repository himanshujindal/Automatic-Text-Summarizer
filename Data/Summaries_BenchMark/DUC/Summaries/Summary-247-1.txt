Two days after Slovenia and Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia, the
federal government mobilized troops to regain control, beginning with
Austrian border crossings. The Slovenian militia, formed in the past
several months, is outmatched by the army's 180,000 troops, armored
vehicles and air force. Fighting across Slovenia resulted in 100 dead
and wounded. The West has lobbied for maintenance of the Yugoslav
state, threatening to withhold aid if the country breaks up. Serbia
fears losing the economic support of Slovenia and Croatia, who supply
most of Yugoslavia's wealth and have tired of the erosion of their
finances by the Serbian-dominated bureaucracy.
