A Wall Street Journal editorial states that the US economy generated
9M new jobs since Congress stopped raising the minimum wage in 1981.
Yet, Organized Labor which supports job creation, makes a strong pitch
for the Kennedy-Hawkins "Minimum Wage Restoration Act".  The Journal
fears that Labor Secretary Brock may compromise away President
Reagan's opposition to the minimum wage.  Kennedy-Hawkins would raise
the wage from $3.35 to $4.65 in three years.  Senator Quayle has
calculated that Democratic projects on minimum wage and health
coverage would add $1.19 to wage costs at the bottom of the income
scale.
