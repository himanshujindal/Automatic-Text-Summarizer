Health officials met in Boston for a four day World Conference on Lung
Health. In parts of Africa, where AIDS has been a health risk,
tuberculosis is running rampant. The combination of the two is
catastrophic. Within the United States there has been a five percent
increase in the number of reported cases, but the numbers vary widely

1989. Newark, New Jersey saw a 35 percent increase in tuberculosis,
and in New York City there has been a 150 percent increase among
blacks.
