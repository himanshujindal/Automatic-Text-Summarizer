Illegal aliens will not be counted in the 1990 Census if the Senate
vote stands.  States with large immigration populations may be
adversely affected.  Now a Senate-House conference committee will
decide whether to attach the illegal immigrants ban to a 17.4 billion
appropriations bill for the State, Commerce and Justice Departments.

Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher will request that President
Bush veto any bill that includes the provisions against counting the
illegal immigrants.

The states of California, Florida, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania
and others stand to loose congressional seats based on this Census
count.
