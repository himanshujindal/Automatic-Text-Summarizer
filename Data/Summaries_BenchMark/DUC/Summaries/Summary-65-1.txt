A few weeks before his nomination to the Supreme Court, Clarence
Thomas outlined his reasons for opposing quotas and affirmative
action. He said that his spirit of independence and belief that that
everyone should take care of himself were developed in his
hardscrabble childhood. He was born near Savannah to an impoverished
family. His grandparents raised him after his father deserted the
family. The ideals preached by his grandfather were reinforced by a
disciplined Catholic education. During his years at Holy Cross College
he embraced some liberal views, but he soon renounced them as contrary
to his grandfather's values.
