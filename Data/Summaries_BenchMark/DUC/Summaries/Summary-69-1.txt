Virginia Thomas, wife of the nominee to the Supreme Court, has come
under scrutiny and is the target of some criticism. Critics see her as
a woman with strong opinions on issues likely to come before the
court. She has represented the conservative views in her work on the
staff of a Republican Congressman. She and the nominee have said that
women and blacks are hindered, rather than helped, by affirmative
action. Virginia Thomas is a white woman, and some prominent blacks
outside government view this as Thomas' rejection of the black
community.
