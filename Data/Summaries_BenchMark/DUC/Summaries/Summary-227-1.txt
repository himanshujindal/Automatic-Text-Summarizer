A recent diamond rush after a small discovery is unlikely to make
development of Canada's first diamond mine worthwhile. In Angola,
illegal mining began in May 1991 when a peace accord allowed freedom
of movement. The De Beers cartel is trying to buy up the $1 million a
day in diamonds being smuggled out to preserve market stability, which
it does by maintaining a buffer pool of diamonds and matching supply
to demand.  After 1980s speculators were bankrupted when recession
forced them to dump diamonds faster than the cartel could buy them, it
has educated banks to discourage lending to speculators.
