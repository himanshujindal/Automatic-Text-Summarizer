The European Commission will tell Germany today that it will take
legal action if Bonn attempts to unilaterally ban British beef for
fear of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease."
The German health minister has been the prime mover for action against
the UK. The commission points out that the EU sets veterinary rules
and that there is no scientific evidence linking BSE with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which affects humans. British officials
point out that they have taken strong measures to control BSE and that
the EU single market will be disrupted unless all members stick to the
scientific evidence.
