In response to a "free market" stand against government imposition of
term limits, this author (Edward Crane) claims two reasons for term
limits that economists should appreciate.  One, the less time a
politician is in Washington the less his common sense will be
corrupted by the "cult to ruling."  Two, few individuals who want to
spend the rest of their life in Washington will be elected.  Crane
feels Congress needs experience in living in the "real world," but
productive citizens do not want to commit 10 to 15 years to politics.
Six-year limits on House service could be viewed as only a leave of
absence from real careers.
