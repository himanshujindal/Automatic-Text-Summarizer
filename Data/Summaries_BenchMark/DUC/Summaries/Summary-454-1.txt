There were many personal stories of panic and wrenching sadness as
thousands of residents of the Mount Pinatubo area fled their homes
after the eruption.  All of nature seemed to be conspiring against the
Philippines.  There were mudslides, torrential rain, floods, and
always the heavy mass of volcanic ash. Communications were down,
emergency food and water supplies were low and the death toll from the
forces of nature now numbers 200.  The heavy thick ash has collapsed
homes and buildings.

Evacuation centers are jammed with people. Angeles is without power
and there is looting because of the lack of food.
