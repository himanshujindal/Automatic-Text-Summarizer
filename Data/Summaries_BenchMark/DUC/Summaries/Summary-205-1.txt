Nationwide opinion polls about the Channel tunnel show convincingly
that: the English do not want a fixed link; they like ferries and
their island story; they are afraid of long, dark tunnels underwater,
and of rabies, rats and terrorists crawling through; not to mention
European undesirables.  However, the tunnel will be a symbol of
European unity.  Moreover, it will reinforce historically dominant
trading links (London - Frankfurt - Milan), bolstering Northern Europe
as an economic entity challenged by a strengthened Mediterranean
"sunbelt".  For the rest of us, it means that you can climb aboard and
whiz from London to Paris in three hours.
