"Mad cow disease" (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE) has killed
10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for British beef and
raised doubts about the safety of eating beef. Although the British
government insists that the incurable disease poses only a remote risk
to human health, scientists are not sure what causes the disease or
how it is transmitted. It has symptoms similar to scrapie, a disease
long observed in sheep, eating holes in the brains of its victims and
in its late stages causing an animal to stagger drunkenly.  There are
two human forms of spongiform encephalopathy: Creutzfeldt- Jakob
disease and kuru.
