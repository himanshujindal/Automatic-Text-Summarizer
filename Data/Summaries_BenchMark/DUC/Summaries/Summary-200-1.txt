A former member of the military prosecution investigation team which
probed the assassination of President Pak Chong-hui by then Central
Intelligence Director Kim Chae-kyu in October 1979, testified that
there was no evidence that then Army Chief of Staff and Martial Law
Commander, Gen. Chong Sung-kwa, was involved in the slaying.  The
charge was not based on concrete evidence but on what he did after Kim
killed Pak.  Accordingly, Chong was nearby when Pak was killed, and a
member of the investigation questioned him at the commander's office
on three occasions suspecting him to be part of a military elite
meeting.
