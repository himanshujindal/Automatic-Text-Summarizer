Pentagon and Air Force officials announced that regular training
flight schedules for aircraft participating in Operation Desert Shield
would resume on Thursday.  It is estimated that the order covered 700
aircraft.  Aircraft training operations had been suspended for 24
hours following a rash of accidents.  Five United States aircraft have
been involved in fatal crashes since the start of Desert Shield.  They
are identified as an F-111, an F-4 reconnaissance jet, an F-15E and
two HU-1 Huey helicopters. In addition, a C-5 transport that crashed
in Germany was ferrying supplies to Saudi Arabia.
