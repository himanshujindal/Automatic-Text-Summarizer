Hispanics in the United States are two to three times more likely to
develop diabetes than the general population.  Heredity and diet seem
to be important factors in a disease that affects 14- 21% of Hispanics
and up to 40% of those 64 to 75 years of age, compared to 7% of all
Americans.

Heredity, a high fat diet and obesity are predisposing factors,
especially in those with American Indian ancestry.

Management includes diet, exercise and medication.

The St. Louis Health Center in Morgan Hill, California is sponsoring a
diabetes management program for Hispanic diabetics.
