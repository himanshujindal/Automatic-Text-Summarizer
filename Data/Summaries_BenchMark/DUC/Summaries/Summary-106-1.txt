Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six
Western states, and a New Mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash
forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in
long-handled nets.

Officials said 566 Gila trout, placed on the endangered species list
in 1967, were fished out of Diamond Creek and brought to the Mescalero
Fish Hatchery.

Meanwhile in California, firefighters battled an arson fire that has
charred more than 3,000 acres.

Firefighters and National Guardsmen contained one of the larger fires
covering 48,000 acres of the Pine Ridge in Nebraska on
Wednesday.
