A major earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter Scale hit Southern
Sudan on Sunday. A quake of that magnitude is capable of causing
widespread destruction. The quake's epicenter was in an isolated
swampland 700 miles from Khartoum, and little damage has been
reported. Flights were going in and out of Juba, the nearest large
city. The epicenter was a little west of the Great African Rift, an
earthquake line that runs from Mozambique through the Red Sea to
Lebanon, but it was the first dangerous earthquake to be reported in
that area.
