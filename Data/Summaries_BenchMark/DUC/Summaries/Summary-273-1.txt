While some Democrats claim term limits are a "right-wing" crusade,
this author (John Fund) believes support from the liberal and
Democratic sphere is increasing.  Polls show Americans back term
limits by 75% to 21% nationwide.  One reason is that term limits would
open up politics to people--minorities and women--now excluded from
office.  Some past Democratic leaders were cited as supporting the
idea, but the party "apparatchiks" remain against it.  Some
journalists favor term limits voicing a need for new blood and the end
of professional politicians.  Fund does not believe enacting term
limits will be easy.
