The Second Amendment to the Constitution reads: "A well regulated
militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of
the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."

The Second Amendment was originated by some of the states as
protection against the federal government.  The word "people" is used
collectively and refers to a political entity such as a state.  The
Supreme Court on several occasions in the past has ruled that this
amendment did not create a federally- protected right of individuals
to bear arms but rather, limited the power of the federal
government.
