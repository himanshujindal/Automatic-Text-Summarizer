The sun, although 400 times wider than the moon, is also 400 times
farther away from the earth.  Thus, twice a year, when their orbits
line up, an eclipse occurs.  Fewer than a third are total.  Any point
on earth is eclipsed just once every 360 years.  In the U.S, the 1991
eclipse, one of the centuries best, will be better than those of 1970
and 1979.  Scientists discovered helium and confirmed Einstein's
theory of bending light through eclipse studies.  This time,
astronomers will study the sun's upper atmosphere, 11-year sunspot
cycle, solar wind and why its outer atmosphere is much hotter than its
inner.
