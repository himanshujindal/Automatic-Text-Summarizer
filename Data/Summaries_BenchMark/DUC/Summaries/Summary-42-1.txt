From Hawaii to Mexico to Central America, more than 40 million people
saw the moon obscure all or much of the sun.  In the Bay area, more
than half the sun was covered when the eclipse peaked at 11:20 a.m.
As totality arrived at Hawaii, a cloud layer hid the sun.  Three of
ten scientific experiments at the astronomy observatory atop
13,800-foot Mauna Kea were thwarted.  In San Jose, people used Mylar
glasses, pinhole cameras, welder's glass and an interference
birefrigent hydrogen alpha filter telescope to view the event.  In
Hawaii, entrepreneurs hawked eclipse t-shirts, hats, posters and
cookies.  Even haircuts.
