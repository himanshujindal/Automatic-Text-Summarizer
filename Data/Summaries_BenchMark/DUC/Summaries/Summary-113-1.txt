Elizabeth Taylor is breathing with the help of a ventilator after
undergoing surgery aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia that
has kept her hospitalized for three weeks, her physicians said on
Monday.

In a prepared statement, Miss Taylor doctors said she was admitted to
St. Johns Hospital last week for treatment of the pneumonia, and was
listed in serious condition in the hospital's intensive-care unit.

Miss Taylor's four children, Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and
Christopher and Michael Wilding were with her at the hospital.

Dr. John Mohler, of the USC School of Medicine said the biopsy will
dictate what therapy to use.
