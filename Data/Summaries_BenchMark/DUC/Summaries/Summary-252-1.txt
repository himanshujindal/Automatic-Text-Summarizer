Slovenia sent a delegation to Belgrade to discuss normalization of
relations with Yugoslavia, including exchanging diplomatic
representatives and abolishing visa requirements for Yugoslav
citizens, but agreement probably won't come soon. The softening of the
Slovene attitude is an effort to adapt Slovene policy to that of the
European Union, which Slovenia wants to join.  Yugoslavia is
distrustful and resents Slovenia's attitude toward Kosovo and support
of arms for Bosnia. It expresses interest in normal relations but says
before they can take place, Slovenia must apologize for its rebuff of
Yugoslavia's offer to recognize Slovenia a year ago, and must end its
anti- Serbian campaign.
