The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and FBI are
investigating a videotaped incident in which a white Long Beach
policeman, Dickey, appeared to shove a black man's (Jackson's) face
into a plate glass window after a routine traffic stop. Although
Dickey's attorney admitted that the officer was wrong to spice his
orders to Jackson with obscenities, Jackson was booked for suspicion
of using offensive language as well as challenging an officer to fight
and obstructing arrest. The assistant district attorney said that
their office has taken on four to six charges of police brutality a
year.
