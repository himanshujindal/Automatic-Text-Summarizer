This morning Judge Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill will appear before
the Senate Judiciary Committee. The session will challenge many
involved in the hearings. Thomas must avoid seeming evasive and
convincingly argue that he did nothing to justify Ms. Hill's
accusations. She must explain why she stuck with Thomas after the
purported incidents.  President Bush faces criticism that he is
insensitive to difficulties faced by working women.  Democratic
Senators must show that they are seriously considering Ms. Hill's
charges while trying to get at the truth and not just at Thomas. The
Republicans want to support Thomas without seeming to wink at sexual
harassment.
