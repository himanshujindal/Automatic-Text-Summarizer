Carlos Tapia, a Peruvian subversion specialist, claims the Shining
Path, although defeated, does not intend to seek reconciliation.  He
believes the government is seeking to strengthen the leadership of
imprisoned Abimael Guzman to counter the faction of free terrorists
headed by Alberto Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano."  Guzman is
organizing a second party congress to recommend the end of violence
and disarmament.  Tapia believes this is an attempt to gain freedom
for the leaders and achieve a semi-legal status for the organization,
which will eventually regroup and pursue original ideological
goals.
