Elizabeth Taylor will remain in St. John's hospital six more weeks due
to complications in her fifth week of treatment for pneumonia, doctors
said.

The recovery of the 58-year old actress, near death two weeks ago with
viral pneumonia, was dealt a setback by bacterial pneumonia and a
yeast infection, her doctors said Friday.

During a news conference last month, Miss Taylor's doctors revealed
she was near death on April 22.

The Oscar-winning star entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April
9 with a sinus infection but was moved to St John's for treatment of
viral pneumonia.
