XINHUA correspondent Feng Xiuju declared that the Legislative
Council's passage of Hong Kong Governor Patten's partial electoral
bill was taken in disregard of persuasion by China and the aspirations
of Hong Kong citizens and are due to change in British policies toward
China.  The British side adopted double-faced tactics in negotiations.
The Basic Law had stipulated that the socialist system and would not
be practiced in Hong Kong and the previous capitalist system would
remain unchanged for 50 years.  Before the Chinese and British agree
on arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections, the bodies produced by
the British-Hong Kong Legislative Council cannot remain beyond
1997.
