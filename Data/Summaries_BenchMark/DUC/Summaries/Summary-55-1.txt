The goal of welfare reform should be: to shrink the welfare system, to
eliminate perverse incentives to remain on welfare, and to make work
the focus of reform.  Many believe the House of Representative's
Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987 fails to do that.  It proposes $5.2
billion in new spending over five years, most to expand existing
welfare programs.  Proponents say the new money is an investment, that
some money will go to new programs to induce welfare recipients off
the rolls and into jobs.  Detractors say it amounts to an expanded
investment in the status quo.
