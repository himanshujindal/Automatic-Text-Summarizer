The Solomon Islands experienced an earthquake at 8:05 p.m. today,
measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale.  There were no immediate reports
of injury or damage, not surprising since the area is sparsely
populated and minimally developed.  No tsunami was reported.  This was
the strongest quake reported in the world in the last five months; the
epicenter was placed on Guadacanal Island.

The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.
That means a reading of 7.5 shows an earthquake ten times stronger
than a quake of 6.5.
