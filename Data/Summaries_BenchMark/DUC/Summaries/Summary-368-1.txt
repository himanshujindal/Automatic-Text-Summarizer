Robert Bork, after being defeated as nominee to the Supreme Court,
joined the American Enterprise Institute and then became a best
selling author by authoring "The Tempting of America." He believes
this book on legal theory may have a positive effect on the views of
future generations, even more so than decisions he may have made on
the Supreme Court.  Are his views vindicated?  He said that he never
felt the need for vindication.  He plans to write two more books, hit
the lecture circuit, teach, write magazine commentary and catch up on
his reading.  Beside mysteries are his other pastime.
