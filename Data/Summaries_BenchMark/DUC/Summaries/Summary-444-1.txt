According to President Quett Masire of Botswana, industrial nations
can assist in relieving Africa's drought and subsequent hunger by
making a greater effort at reducing global warming. Masire and
Dr. Bernard Ledea Ouedraogo, an anti-hunger organizer in Burkina Faso,
were awarded the 1988 Africa Prize for Leadership for their
anti-hunger efforts.

Although a severe drought afflicted Africa from 1981 to 1987, not one
person in Botswana died of drought-induced famine.

Dr. Ouedraogo, the other prizewinner, organized the peasants in nine
African countries. As a result, new crop-raising techniques were
learned, erosion was checked, forests replanted and health care
improved.
