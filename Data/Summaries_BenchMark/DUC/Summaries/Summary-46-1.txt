Madison, Florida, a town of 3500 people, is about fifty miles east of
Tallahassee.  Before dawn, a tornado blasted through town, destroying
several homes and a college library, blowing off rooftops, flipping
cars and leaving four people dead and fifteen injured.  Two of the
deaths occurred in mobile homes that were blown apart.  It lasted
under thirty minutes.  Two other tornadoes struck about 100 miles west
of Madison.  All were spawned by a storm system that struck across the
Southeast.  A belt of thunderstorms being pushed by a cold front
caused hail and damaging winds in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and
Georgia.
