A two seat T-2 Buckeye jet trainer crashed Sunday on the flight deck
of the carrier Lexington as it was cruising 17 miles south of
Pensacola, Florida.  The jet was assigned to Training Squadron 19 at
the Meridian, Mississippi Naval Air Station.  Five were killed and
others injured. Several short-lived fires broke out on the World War
II-class carrier, the only one used exclusively for flight training.
Two aircraft on the flight deck suffered major damage.  Helicopters
took the injured to hospitals on the mainland.
