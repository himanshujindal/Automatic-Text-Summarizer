US track and field officials said that Johnson should be stripped of
his world record in the 100 meter dash.  Johnson testified at a
Canadian inquiry that he had been involved with illegal
performance-enhancing drugs for seven years and had injections before
he set the world record in the 1987 World Championship in Rome.  His
coach and physician had also testified at the inquiry.  Carl Lewis
said that while Johnson had not told the truth earlier, he was doing
so now and speaking out against drugs and should be allowed back in
the sport after he finishes his suspension.
