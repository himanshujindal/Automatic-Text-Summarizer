Exxon salvage crews successfully refloated the stricken tanker Exxon
Valdez after nearly 1M barrels of oil were pumped to smaller tankers
and air was forced into the Valdez tanks.  Clean-up from the spill
continued as the oil slick was estimated to affect an area the size of
Delaware.  Alaska Governor Cowper said the coast Guard could better
handle the clean-up than Exxon.  James Hazelwood, captain of the
Valdez, who had been found to be legally drunk and was fired by Exxon,
surrendered to police in a Long Island suburb of New York City.
Released on $500,000 bail he may not waive extradition to
Alaska.
