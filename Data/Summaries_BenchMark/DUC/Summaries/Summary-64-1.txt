When President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to become the second
black to serve on the Supreme Court, he named a man whose views are at
the opposite end of the spectrum from those of Thurgood Marshall, the
man he would succeed. Thomas was only five years old when Marshall,
the first black to serve, was appointed to the court.  Marshall helped
to create the world in which Thomas grew up. Thomas opposes
affirmative action and quotas, and his views on other issues dear to
liberals are largely unknown. Some Democrats have said they will be
diligent in drawing out Thomas' views on controversial issues.
