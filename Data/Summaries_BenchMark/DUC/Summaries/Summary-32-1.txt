The Christopher Commission's scathing report on the Los Angeles Police
Department found racism, brutality, inadequate discipline,
mismanagement and a "siege mentality" pitting officers against the
community. Now critics are calling for the same kind of independent
investigation of the sheriff's department after sheriff's deputies
shot four people dead in the space of one month, three deputies were
charged with stealing credit cards from elderly people, and there have
been renewed charges that the department is home to white supremacist
gangs. The FBI, Amnesty International and the county grand jury are
investigation allegations about both the police and sheriff's
departments.
