The biggest oil spill in US history created a slick seven miles long
and seven wide in Prince William Sound from 240,000 barrels of crude
from the Exxon Valdez.  The Golob Oil Pollution Bulletin called this a
major environmental catastrophe and that clean-up equipment at the
site was grossly inadequate.  Alaska has a plan for action within five
hours of a spill but it took hours longer and insufficient equipment
was employed initially.  A Greenpeace spokesman said the whole food
chain could be affected.  A Coast Guard spokesman said some
blood-alcohol tests were given to crew but no results yet available.
National Transportation Safety Board officials were expected on site
soon.
