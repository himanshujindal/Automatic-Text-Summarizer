Climatologist Ira Browning said there was a 50-50 chance of a major
earthquake today along the New Madrid Fault, which stretches from
Arkansas northeast through New Madrid, Missouri and into Cairo,
Illinois.  No tremors were reported.

Some residents took precautions, however: some schools closed, some
residents left town and some purchased earthquake emergency kits.

The U.S. Geological Survey, which received many calls from area
residents, did not back the prediction. Waverly Person of the Survey
says, "Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting
them is difficult, if not impossible.  Mr. Browning's prediction was
based on a study of tidal forces.
