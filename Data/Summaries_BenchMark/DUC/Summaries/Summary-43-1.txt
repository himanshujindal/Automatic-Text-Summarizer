In San Jose, the eclipse will begin at 10:10 a.m., peak at 11:20 and
end at 12:34 p.m.  Do not look at it through film negatives, a camera
viewfinder or sunglasses.  Use special Mylar glasses or punch a hole
in a piece of paper and look downward at the shadow.  You will sense
the eclipse better from a mountaintop or from your roof.  Most of the
Bay area is expected to be sunny.  However, it may still be foggy
along the coast.  Do not look at the sun through the fog.  The next
major eclipse will be in another 151 years.
