General Colin Powell won unanimous approval from the Senate Armed
Services Committee on Wednesday to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.  Powell told the panel he has "some level of confidence" that
reforms might succeed in the Soviet Union, giving the US
"opportunities" to reshape our defense programs, our national security
policies, and our armed forces.  He warned that changes in Soviet
military capabilities, not budget restraints, should prompt the
scaleback and called for continual modernization of long-range nuclear
weapons.  He also said he would make the military's role in the drug
war one of his top priorities.
