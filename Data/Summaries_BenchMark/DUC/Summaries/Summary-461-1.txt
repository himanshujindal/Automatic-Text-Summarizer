A Chinese writer, Zhong Yan, says that since Chris Patten has become
governor of Hong Kong he has been going against China.  For this he
has been criticized and condemned by China, and people in Hong Kong
and Britain.  While Patten says that his responsibility toward the
citizens of Hong Kong should be first, the writer says that Patten is
more concerned about the colony than the people.  He also chides
Patten for saying that Hong Kong is the most important part of
Sino-British relations.  Zhong Yan believes that Patten has been
trying to preserve the colonial position in Hong Kong.
