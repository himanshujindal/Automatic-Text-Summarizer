Slovenia was the richest of the former Yugoslav republics, with strong
tourism and roads connecting Europe to the Adriatic.  Since
independence, the UN embargo on trade with Serbia has meant loss of a
large market and an end to cheap Serbian raw materials.  Slovenia is
lowering wages and increasing productivity to compensate. It is
privatizing industries and implementing market reforms, determined to
become a market-oriented, multi-party, parliamentary
democracy. Relations with Croatia are good but complicated by several
issues. Slovenian leaders criticize the west for failing to intervene
earlier to stop Serbia's aggression against a UN-recognized state, and
for terming the Bosnian war civil or ethnic.
