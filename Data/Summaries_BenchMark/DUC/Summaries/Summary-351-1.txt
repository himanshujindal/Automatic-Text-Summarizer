Today President Bush addressed the people of Iraq.  He said that Iraqi
leadership decided to occupy Kuwait, a member of the United Nations
and the Arab League.  The world will not allow this aggression to
stand.  Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait for the sake of principle, of
peace and for the sake of the Iraqi people.  Bush said that after
eight long years of war with Iran, he does not believe the Iraqi
people again want war.  Neither does America.  It is still possible to
end this crisis peacefully.  Iraq stands against the world.  It cannot
win.  It must withdraw from Kuwait.
