Clarence Thomas was born 43 years ago in a rural area near
Savannah. His father deserted the family, and Clarence was raised by
his maternal grandparents. Under the direction of his grandfather and
the nuns who schooled him, he learned sharecropping, scholarship, and
hard labor. He was later impressed by Thomas Sowell, a prominent black
economist, who advised blacks to pursue economic independence rather
than political agitation. He developed into a hybrid product of harsh
Southern history and baby-boomer ambition, and a proponent of strength
over dependence. His black conservatism made him a favorite of
Republican administrations.
