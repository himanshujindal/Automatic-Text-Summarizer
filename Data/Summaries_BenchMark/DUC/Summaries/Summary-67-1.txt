As the date of his confirmation hearings approach, Clarence Thomas'
life and record are being examined, and even his close friends have
trouble explaining why Thomas has become a minority within a
minority. In his college years Thomas shared the liberal views of many
bright young blacks born into a segregated America after the 1964
Civil Rights Act erased the overt signs of segregation. As an
undergraduate at Holy Cross, he marched in protests but he became more
conservative as he studied law at Yale. After Yale he worked for a
Republican State Attorney General, and by then he was expressing
conservative viewpoints.
