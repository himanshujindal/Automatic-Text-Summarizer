Two new studies show the men and women who battle wildfires face an
unseen hazard -- the effects from poisonous gasses and soot in
wildfire smoke.  Among the culprits are carbon monoxide (impairs
judgement), microscopic carbon particles (lodges in the lungs),
aldehydes (irritates air passages), and hydrocarbon-based substances
(gene damage and cancer).  Wildfire smoke also may accelerate aging,
prompt fatal heart attacks, and trigger respiratory diseases
(bronchitis or asthma).  Overly heavy gear and inadequate filters are
major problems.  Developing protection has received little attention.
Researchers have asked Congress to fund a $13.4 million study on
health threat and respiratory protection.
