Britain risks failing to take full advantage of the cross-channel
"Chunnel" due to the Thatcher government's announcement yesterday that
it would not help fund a high-speed rail line between London and the
tunnel.  This fuels fears that the country's creaky transportation
system will isolate Britain.  The lack of the high-speed rail link,
and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the
tunnel's total benefits.  The consortium formed to build the link
asked the government for a financial contribution, which the
government says involves "unacceptable" risks to the taxpayer.
Industrialists fear poor links will isolate them from the European
Community's single market.
