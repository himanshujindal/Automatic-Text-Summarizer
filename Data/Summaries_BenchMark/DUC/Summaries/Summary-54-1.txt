The National Governors Association presented a welfare reform plan to
President Reagan that would require welfare recipients to do something
productive to earn their benefits, be it completing school, receiving
vocational training or holding a job.  The governors' proposal will
cost $2 billion per year in addition to the $100 billion now spent on
poverty programs.  Reagan doesn't like their plan's national minimum
benefit level, which he believes will undercut each states' ability to
set its own standard.  Several states have already launched successful
work-for-welfare programs, thus encouraging many other states to try
something similar. Reform consensus seems to be building.
