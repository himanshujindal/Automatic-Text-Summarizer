Slovenian president Milan Kucan endorsed a plan for a constitution
giving Slovenia full sovereignty and international-legal rights within
a new Yugoslav confederation.  Slovenia's parliament almost certainly
will approve the plan. Serbian politicians have frequently accused
Slovenia of harboring separatist tendencies and protecting its own
interests at the expense of federal goals. Slovenia says Serbia is
trying to politically and economically dominate the Yugoslav
federation by introducing greater federal control. In a poll last
March, 70% of Slovenia's 2 million inhabitants thought the region
would be better off outside the Yugoslav federation. Slovenia and
Croatia both held free elections this year.
