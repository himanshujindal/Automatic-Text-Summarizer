The Social Services director in Orange County wants all residents in
the county to be counted in the 1990 Census. He will ask the Board of
Supervisors to pass a resolution supporting his position.

If the approximate 200,000 illegal aliens were not counted, the county
would loose an estimated $56 million a year in federal revenue and
lose representatives in Congress.

On Thursday, the U.S. Senate and House agreed that illegal aliens
should be counted.  Before Thursday, the Senate had voted to bar the
Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens.  The House had twice
rejected efforts to exclude aliens.
