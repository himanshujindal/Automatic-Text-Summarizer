The estimate is being made that Mount Pinatubo, which began to erupt
on Saturday, will explode and send its deadly hot ash toward Clark Air
Force Base on Luzon.  Also at risk are 350 thousand residents of
Angeles City.  Even the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base
closed indefinitely.

Volcanic eruptions are caused when one of the earth's plates collides
or moves apart and pressure from the earth's interior melts the rock
and forces it to the surface.  Pinatubo's last eruption 600 years ago
produced as much molten rock as Mount St. Helens in 1980.

The ash produced by a catastrophic eruption would be especially
dangerous to in-flight aircraft, whose engines would stall.

Sensitive instruments placed by U.S. and Philippine scientists
continue to monitor the mountain.
