"California" Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford called
Charles Keating a "con man" who relied on lies and bought political
influence.  He used both to deceive and intimidate state
regulators. The U.S. took over his scandel-plagued Lincoln Savings and
Loan of Irvine, California in April.

Associates who knew Keating say that he was a dominant personality who
believed that he was above the law.

Keating certainly was aware of his own misdeeds in the high roller
world of acquisitions, money shifting and illegal pay-offs to
politicians. He used the latter and a staff of lawyers to protect his
financial empire.
