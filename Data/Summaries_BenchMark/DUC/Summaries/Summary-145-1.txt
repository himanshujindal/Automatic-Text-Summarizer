Lord Bauer, House of Lords, makes the following comments to "Letters
to the Editor," Financial Times, from a Mr. Skinner:

a. Skinner charged Bauer with misunderstanding the debt burden of poor
countries. Bauer comments that the loans do not increase with
inflation and are at zero interest. Further, these loans are often
canceled or rescheduled.

b. Skinner claimed that Africa's poverty is externally-caused. Bauer
believes that it is domestically-caused by government policies.

c. Bauer believes that the poor are at the bottom of the priority list
of local rulers.

d.Skinner's encouragement of default is counter-productive. Bauer
points to the success of Southeast Asia.
