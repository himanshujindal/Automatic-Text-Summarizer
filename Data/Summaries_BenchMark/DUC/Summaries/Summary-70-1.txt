The town of Pinpoint, Georgia celebrated Clarence Thomas' elevation to
the Supreme Court. When yesterday's climactic votes ensured that
Thomas had survived the Senate ordeal, his mother, Leona Williams,
literally jumped for joy. She immediately called her son to give him
her love. A handwritten sign that had already been erected proclaimed
that Pinpoint, Georgia was the home of Judge Clarence Thomas. The
community gathered in front of the town's only big screen television,
and applauded and sang when the victory of the native son was
certain.
