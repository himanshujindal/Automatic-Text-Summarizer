The upcoming Senate hearings on Clarence Thomas' qualifications and
fitness to serve on the Supreme Court will be a lesson for
everyone. His life will be viewed as living proof that a black man
from the impoverished South can rise to the heights of the Supreme
Court. His supporters say that he is an example of one who relied on
the love of his extended family, and worked hard in rising from a
humble beginning to a position of prominence. It is anticipated that
his detractors will acknowledge that, but will maintain that he was
helped along by the same government aid that he would deny to
others.
