Mount Pinatubo erupted violently today and sent a cloud of steam and
ash 10 miles into the sky. Warning sirens and church bells sounded at
Clark Air Base and surrounding communities. Terrified residents
clogged roads in the area of Pinatubo.

U.S. and Philippine volcanologists believed that more eruptions would
follow and that everyone within 12 miles of Pinatubo should evacuate
immediately.

Communications with scientists taking measurements on the mountain
were unsuccessful.  It is known that this team had planned to make a
helicopter flight over the mountain to check the size of the lava dome
inside the volcano.
