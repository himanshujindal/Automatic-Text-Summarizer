The Clinton administration has given approval for pilot welfare plans
in Wisconsin and Georgia.  The Wisconsin plan cuts off cash payments
after two years but continues food stamps and health care.  The
Georgia plan does not have a time limit for benefits, but reduces
payments to able-bodied adults who refuse offers of work and denies
increased benefits to long-time welfare mothers who have more
children.  The federal government, which must grant waivers from
normal welfare rules, is also considering requests from Florida and
Vermont for time limits on benefits.  National welfare reform is
delayed until the budget and healthcare reform are resolved.
