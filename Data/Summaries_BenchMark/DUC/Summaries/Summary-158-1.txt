The stripping of Ben Johnson's Olympic Gold Medal has wounded Canadian
pride and shamed the nation.  Johnson's physician, George Astaphan,
and agent, Larry Heidebrect, insisted that Johnson had not taken
stanzolol.  Heidebrect said it is a tragedy, mistake, or sabotage.
Johnson a 26-year-old Jamaican transplant had waved the Canadian Flag
in triumph after the race and before the drug test.  There was
enormous exhilaration, then 72 hours later the roller coaster ride to
the bottom.  One Canadian newspaper said that Johnson tarnished the
reputation of Canada and let the people down.
