In May federal health officials announced that the rate of
tuberculosis for those in prison might be more than three times as
great as for those on the outside. In some states it is even
higher. In New Jersey, for example, it is 11 times
higher. Tuberculosis is a contagious disease, and those in close
contact with an active carrier of tuberculosis are at greater
risk. This is a big issue in prisons where there often is
overcrowding, poor circulation of air and an environment conducive to
the spread of contagious diseases.
