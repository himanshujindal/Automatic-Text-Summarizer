A United Airlines DC-10 with 293 aboard crashed just short of Sioux
City, Iowa's airport on July 20, 1989, after the pilot tried for
thirty minutes to bring the huge aircraft under control.  The plane
crashed into a cornfield and broke apart, then exploded and burned.
166 passengers walked away; 127 were killed.

The cause of the crash was complete hydraulic failure, unusual because
the DC-10 has three independent hydraulic systems, each capable of
controlling the plane.

It is believed that an engine exploded, causing metal shards to cut
some common ducts in the tail section, leading to the failure.
