The Senate has voted to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal
aliens despite arguments from the Bush Administration it is both
unconstitutional and unworkable.

Senators in favor of counting aliens said that a ban is impractical
because the Census Bureau forms have been printed and they do not
contain a question about legal status.

Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-NY, said that all residents have been
counted for 190 years.  If that is changed, he said it would destroy
confidence in the census results.

Mario Moreno, head of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund said the
shocking decision of the Senate would discourage people in the
Hispanic community from participating.
