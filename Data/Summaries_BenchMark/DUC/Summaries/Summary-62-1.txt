Speaking on national television on Monday, Clarence Thomas praised his
grandparents for teaching him to rely on himself and instilling the
values that allowed him to succeed in a hostile environment. Their
hard-working grandparents took in Clarence and his brother after their
own father deserted the family and their mother remarried. Clarence
was seven years old and his grandfather taught him perseverance,
discipline and the value of hard work. The grandfather enrolled him in
a segregated Catholic school in Savannah, and Thomas also credited the
nuns for reinforcing the discipline preached by his grandfather.
