The United States has denied an accusation by Yasser Arafat that the
United States is threatening to kill PLO officials if Palestinian
guerrillas attack American targets.  The State Department said it has
received reports that the PLO might target Americans because of
alleged US involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir.  The
PLO's second in command, in a raid on his house near Tunis on 16
April.  Israeli officials said that an Israeli squad carried out the
assassination.  Apparently, Arafat's claims stem from his
interpretation of US correspondence with Middle East countries about
possible PLO attacks against American citizens and facilities.
