Fundamental welfare reform is needed within the 24 member nations of
the Organization for Economic Co-operation if these states are to
protect their most vulnerable citizens without endangering their
economies.  Welfare costs, principally for pensions, healthcare,
unemployment benefits and family support are rapidly becoming
insupportable.  The costliest item is pensions, which continue to grow
due to increased coverage, benefit levels and an aging population.  By
the year 2040, people over age 65 will rise from their current 19% of
total population to 37%.  In a competitive global economy, no country
can burden its businesses with higher welfare costs than its
neighbors.
