Within days, a series of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms swept
through fourteens states and the District of Columbia causing death,
injury and destruction.  At least 27 people have died, more than 500
are injured and hundreds have been left homeless.  The most serious
damage occurred in Huntsville, Alabama where 17 people were killed,
463 injured and about 1,000 left homeless.  In Newburgh, New York,
about 60 miles north of New York City, a tree crashed through the roof
of an elementary school killing seven children and injuring eighteen.
Thousands of utility customers are without power and property damage
is in the millions.
