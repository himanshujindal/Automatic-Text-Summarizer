Harry Oppenheimer and son Nicholas, whose family controls the De Beers
diamond cartel, will visit Russia next week to ensure continued De
Beers grip on the Russian diamond market. The Soviet Union signed a
five-year sales contract with the cartel in 1990. After the country's
break-up De Beers signed a sales agreement with the autonomous
republic Yukutia, where most Russian diamonds are mined. Yukutia plans
a joint-stock company and opposes a Russian parliament plan for
exclusive rights to buy all diamonds mined in the Russian
Federation. Unofficial Russian diamond exports have been rumored and
two Belgian traders have been temporarily barred from De Beers
sales.
