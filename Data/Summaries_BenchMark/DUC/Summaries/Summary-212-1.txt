The city of Santa Barbara, California has introduced the idea of
fire-resistant garden landscaping--firescaping--to help homeowners
improve the chances of their property surviving brush fires.  The
garden is landscaped into four plant zones with the most flammable in
Zone 4, farthest from the house.  Zone 3 plants have low profile and
slow- burning characteristics.  Zone 2 features highly fire-retardant
succulents, acting as a greenbelt zone of maximum protection.  Zone 1,
closest to the residence, is a small area of plants that pose little
risk of burning.  Xeriscaping, landscaping with drought-tolerant
native plants, is also becoming commonplace.
