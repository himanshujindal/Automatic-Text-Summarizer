After a Slovenian coalition of center-right parties trounced reform
communists in the first free state elections held in Yugoslavia in 45
years, the new government unanimously proclaimed Slovenia's full
sovereignty. Slovenia would have an independent legal system, its own
intelligence services, and would control armed forces stationed within
the republic. A new democratic constitution would be adopted within
the next 12 months.  The new authorities say Slovenia will declare
full independence if remaining republics do not accept its proposals
for a confederation, vehemently opposed by Serbia. Monday's
proclamation may have been affected by a recent Serbian crackdown on
Kosovo autonomy.
