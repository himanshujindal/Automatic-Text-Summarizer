In 1955 Life magazine wondered if Las Vegas wasn't overbuilt.  More
than 30 years later the city has grown from a few resorts to a booming
metropolis of more than 600,000 people and nearly 60,000 hotel and
motel rooms.

Nearly 20,000 new hotel rooms are either under construction or
awaiting groundbreaking.  Figures show that 90.2 percent occupancy
during 1987.  This caused potential guest to be turned away especially
on holiday weekends.

Visitors nearly doubled in the last 12 years with and estimated 17
million tourist expected in 1988.  Part of the Las Vegas lure also
comes from room rates that average $45 a night.
