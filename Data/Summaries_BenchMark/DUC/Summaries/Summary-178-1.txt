Hurricane Joan churned across the open Caribbean following an unusual,
coast-hugging path.  Fifty people were reported dead or missing in a
town in Colombia.  Panama issued a Hurricane Watch for Joan which is
the Atlantic Season's fifth hurricane.  Joan is expected to leave
heavy rains along its path.  A strong high pressure system over the
northern Caribbean is keeping Joan on its course.  Normally winds and
atmospheric conditions push northward as they move from the Atlantic.
Gilbert, the most devastating Hurricane in recent years, left 300
people dead and caused billions of dollars of damage in Jamaica,
Cayman Islands, and Mexico.
