Patience is a much-desired quality for the 26.2-mile runner.

This was the case on Sunday during the Long Beach Marathon.  The two
winners, Rex Wilson of New Zealand and Wen Yanmin of China, waited for
others to make mistakes and for the sun to take its toll.

Wilson set a pace of 5 minutes per mile and took the lead at the
10-mile marker.  At this pace, he set a course record.

Yanmin, a student from Beijing, also set a course record.  She had to
overcome the lead of another runner in a close finish.
