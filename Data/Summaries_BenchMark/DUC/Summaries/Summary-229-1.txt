Investors are being sought for a diamond mine in Zimbabwe which De
Beers discovered in 1975 but gave up rights to in 1991 because of the
political situation and failing to reach a marketing agreement with
the Zimbabwe government. De Beers bulldozed the site before leaving
and all documentation about deposits disappeared. Mr. Robin Baxter-
Brown, one of the new joint owners of River Ranch Mine, started his
career with De Beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration
experience. The deposit is estimated as 17.5 million tonnes, 60% of
gem quality, and there is likely another deposit nearby.  Mining began
in March.
