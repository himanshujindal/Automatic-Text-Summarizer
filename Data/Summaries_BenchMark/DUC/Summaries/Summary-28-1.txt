The Police Chief of San Jose, CA, argues that the brutal beating of
Rodney King by four Los Angeles policemen would not have happened if
the four had feared that any of the 17 other officers watching would
report their criminal actions.  Other chiefs of police must forsake
their own code of silence and condemn Police Chief Daryl Gates. The
people of Los Angeles believe that police brutality is common and
disapprove of the way Mr. Gates has done his job. The cloud Gates has
cast over policing won't be lifted until police chiefs speak out
against one of their own.
