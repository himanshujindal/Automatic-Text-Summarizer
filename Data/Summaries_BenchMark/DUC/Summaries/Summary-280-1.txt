Robert Barro discusses his surprise that some free market advocates,
with their faith in the self-interested consumer, support term limits.
The free marketers claim incumbent politicians have an unfair
advantage, 95% of the incumbents were re-elected, and a citizen
Congress would result in better government.  Barro believes decreasing
the excessive incentive of maintaining a legislator's seniority status
may be a better solution.  Legislative branch term limits are an
attempt to shift power back to the executive branch, now subjected to
limits.  Barro believes ending executive limits would be a better
solution, especially since there is no evidence that they improved
governing.
