Lawmakers are having difficulty coming to an agreement on whether or
not illegal aliens should be counted in the 1990 census.

The U.S. Constitution requires the Census Bureau to count all the
"persons" in the country every ten years for purposes of
reapportionment of seats in the house of representatives.  It does not
specify citizens.  Some representatives feel that illegal aliens, if
counted, may give some states like California and Texas and extra
seat.  Since there is a 435-seat limit, some representatives fear that
their states may loose a seat.
 
In the past, every state has counted legal and illegal aliens in the
census.
