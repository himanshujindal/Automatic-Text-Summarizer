Canadians were shamed, angry, and saddened that sprinter Ben Johnson
had been stripped of his Olympic Gold Medal for using performance
enhancing drugs.  Canada's only Gold Medal was then awarded to second
place finisher Carl Lewis of the US in the 100 meter dash.  Canadian
government officials called the incident a "national embarrassment"
and the Sports Minister said Johnson would be banned for life from
Canada's National Team.  Some Canadian athletes and Johnson's family
expressed support for Johnson; some expressed sympathy, and others
said they had no respect for drug users.
