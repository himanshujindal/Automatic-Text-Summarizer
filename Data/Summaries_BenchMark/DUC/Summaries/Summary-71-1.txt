Two United States Air Force F-16 fighters, each carrying a single
pilot crashed from the 50th Tactical Air Wing at Hahn, collided and
exploded at 1:30 P.M. today.  The aircraft crashed near a populated
area south of Mainz, but no one on the ground was injured.  The West
German Police said one pilot was killed, but the Air Force did not
confirm the death.  The crash came less than two hours after another
F-16, this one from the 52nd Tactical Wing at Spangdahlen crashed into
the Black Forest after that pilot ejected.
