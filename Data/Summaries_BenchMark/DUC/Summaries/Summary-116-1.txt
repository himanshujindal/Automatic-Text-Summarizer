Elizabeth Taylor, hospitalized for viral pneumonia, suffered
complications including bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection and
will be hospitalized for about six more weeks, doctors said on Friday.

Miss Taylor is being treated with antibiotics that are effective
against bacteria but not viruses.

"She is tolerating this therapy extremely well and her doctors are
pleased with her progress," Miss Taylor's publicist, Chem Sam, said
after talking to doctors.

Earlier this week, Ms. Sam said the 58-year-old actress was improving
and would be released from the hospital this week.

Last month, Miss Taylor's doctors revealed she was near death on April
22.
