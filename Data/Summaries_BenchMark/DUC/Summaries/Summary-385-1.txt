An employee of the security consulting firm hired by lawyers
representing Pan American's insurance carriers gave polygraph tests to
three Pan American baggage handlers in Frankfurt, Germany. Families of
the victims killed in the 1988 bombing of a Pan American flight over
Scotland have a 300 million dollar law suit against Pan
American. Polygraph results are not admissible in court, but polygraph
results can be used to provide new leads in the case. The man who
administered the polygraph tests in Germany was served a subpoena on
his return to the United States, and testified before a federal grand
jury last week.
