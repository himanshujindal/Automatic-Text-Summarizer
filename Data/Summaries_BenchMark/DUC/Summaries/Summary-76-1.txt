A United States Air Force A-10 attack jet crashed and burned in
Britain this morning while on a routine training flight.  The aircraft
was assigned to the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing at Alconbury.  The
plane crashed 25 miles north of Cambridge.  The fate of the pilot is
not known.  Another A-10 Thunderbolt crashed in Germany two weeks ago,
and on the same day as the German crash, still another A-10 went down
in Arizona.  Despite the recent spate of accidents, statistics show
that the A-10 is the safest fighter or attack plane in the inventory.
