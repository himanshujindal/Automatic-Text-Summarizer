After Vice President Gore's debate victory over Ross Perot, a poll
found NAFTA support up from 34% to 57%. US NAFTA opponents believe
fear of job and investment losses to Mexico will outweigh any new
enthusiasm. A survey of executives of medium-sized companies in
Canada, Mexico and the US showed a majority supporting NAFTA. The
Mexican congress criticized Perot's claims -- that Mexicans were badly
treated, oppressed and mostly living in poverty while 34 families
owned half the country -- as ignorant, offensive, and without
foundation. The anti-NAFTA whip announced he had enough votes to
defeat NAFTA but wanted a safe margin.
