Tokyo experienced a devastating earthquake in 1923 that resulted in
143,000 deaths.  Experts feel that Tokyo is likely to experience
another crushing quake. The city is situated over the meeting point of
the Eurasian, Philippine and Pacific plates, three of the giant
tectonic plates that make up the earths' crust, and they are grinding
together and setting the stage for a catastrophe. An earthquake
measuring eight on the Richter Scale could result in 150,000
deaths. Japan is moving ahead on research and is trying to develop the
worlds best warning system, but nothing can reduce the geological
hazard under the city.
