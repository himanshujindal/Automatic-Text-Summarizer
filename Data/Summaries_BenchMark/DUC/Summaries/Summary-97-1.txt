California officials have condemned a U.S. Senate vote to exclude
illegal aliens from the census.  They fear that California will be
shortchanged by millions of dollars in federal aid for programs for
poor people.  California is thought to have at least 50% of the
nation's 3 to 8 million illegal aliens.

The Senate bill is expected to face tough opposition in the House
where states with large alien population such as California, New York
and Illinois have many votes.  Furthermore, a federal court in
Pittsburgh ruled earlier that excluding illegal aliens from the census
would be unconstitutional.
