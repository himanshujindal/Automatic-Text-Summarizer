Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson left the Seoul Olympics stripped of his
Gold Medal after positive drug tests.  Neither a spiked drink nor a
switched sample as suggested by his coach could have accounted for the
levels of steroids found in his tests.  Johnson has been suspended
from international competition for two years and banned from Canada's
national team for life.  Prime Minister Mulroney called this a moment
of great sorrow for all Canadians.  US sprinter Carl Lewis hoped that
Johnson would straighten out his life and return to competition.
Lewis had said after the event that he couldn't understand how Johnson
ran so fast after looking tired in qualifying heats.
