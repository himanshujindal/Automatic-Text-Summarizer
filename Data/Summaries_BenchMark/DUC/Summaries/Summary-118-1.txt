Reporters from across the country gathered for a news conference at
St. John's Hospital for information on the condition of Elizabeth
Taylor.  Miss Taylor has been treated for pneumonia and has been
hospitalized for 5 weeks.

It has inspired a raft of rumors and handed up a field day for the
tabloids.

Partly because of gossip, Miss Taylor's doctors at St. John's Hospital
in Santa Monica called a press conference.  No AIDS, they said.  No
cancer.  For the tabloid press has been humming with rumors that Liz
Taylor had AIDS.
