At the Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, strategists and
quartermasters direct the nation's wildfire battles.  Specialists in
the logistics center marshal resources from around the nation.  In the
logistics room, the intelligence division keeps track of fires around
the country.  Another unit finds the crews and equipment to attack the
flames.  A big chalkboard plots the fires as they eat up the fuel.
Magnets resembling aircraft dot a map of the country giving the type
of equipment available.  Requests are for airplanes, helicopters, axes
and shovels, portable marine pumps, hoses, fresh fruit, disposable
sleeping bags, soft drinks, and manpower.
