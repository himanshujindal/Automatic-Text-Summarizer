President Reagan has made welfare reform a priority.  His Domestic
Policy Council drafted a blueprint giving states wider latitude to
experiment with reform.  Many governors have unveiled plans of their
own.

A welfare lobbying coalition of 80 organizations has issued a
statement calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs
programs.  They insist that the federal government has "primary
responsibility" for welfare.  Congressional Democrats seem to agree
with them.  Americans are already spending more than $100 billion a
year on welfare.  It may be necessary for Reagan to form an alliance
of reform-minded governors and the public to change the status
quo.
