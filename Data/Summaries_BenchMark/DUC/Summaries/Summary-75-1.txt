A United States Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt attack jet crashed
Thursday, killing seven people on the ground while cutting a wide
swath through a working class neighborhood in the West German town of
Remscheid. Air Force officials could not explain why the aircraft
crashed.  On Saturday citizens of Remscheid marched in protest, and
asked for an end to low level flight training.  West German officials
are worried that the crash would have an adverse affect on the
dwindling support for defense issues.  West German skies are crowded
with military flights, and even before Thursday's crash, 12 major
accidents had befallen NATO aircraft this year.
