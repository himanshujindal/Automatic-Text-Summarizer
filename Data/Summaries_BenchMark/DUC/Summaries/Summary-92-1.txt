The Census head count will begin on April 1, 1990.  These figures are
used to redistribute the 435 House seats and to distribute federal aid
to local governments.

Aliens have been counted in the past but military personal stationed
overseas have not.  The Census Department and the Department of
Defense are devising a plan to count the military and determine which
states may count them.

Census officials contend that they have no way to determine who is in
the country legally.  It would be difficult to get aliens to tell the
truth or participate in the census at all if they were asked about
their status.
