Tetsuya Theodore Fujita is an American professor of geophysical
science.  He is one of the world's foremost authorities on violent
storms.  He discovered that most tornadoes are actually six or seven
small twisters called suction vortices, rotating around the center of
a larger tornado.  He developed a 1 to 5 scale for measuring the
strength of tornadoes.  However, his best work may be on other air
movements called downbursts and microbursts.  It is believed these
phenomena have been the cause of 17 aircraft accidents in the past 15
years.  His work helped persuade the FAA to install new radars at
major airports.
