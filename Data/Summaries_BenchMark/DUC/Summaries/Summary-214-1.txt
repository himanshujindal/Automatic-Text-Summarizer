Because of a five-year drought and rains that nurtured grass now
turning dry, California is gearing up for a dangerous wildfire season.
Firefighters are most concerned about certain rural areas.  Residents
have been advised to take special precautions; notably, clearing a
30-foot defensible space of dry grass and brush around the house;
removing all pine needles and leaves from roofs, eaves and gutters;
trimming tree limbs within 10 feet of the chimney and all limbs
hanging over the house or garage; treating wood shingle roofs with
fire retardant; making sure of adequate access for firefighters;
ensuring that neighborhood streets are clearly identified.
