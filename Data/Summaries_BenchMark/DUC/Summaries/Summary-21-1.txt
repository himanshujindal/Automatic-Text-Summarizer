Deaths of two elderly blacks in a drug raid gone awry followed 10 days
later by a scuffle at a downtown hotel have aroused a demand for an
outside review of the Minneapolis Police Department. The deaths
resulted from a fire started when police hurled a stun grenade into
the apartment of the deceased. In the hotel incident, police,
responding to a complaint of a loud party, are alleged to have used
the term "nigger" and to have beaten some of those arrested. The
president of the Minneapolis Urban League says that police brutality
has been a problem there for years.
