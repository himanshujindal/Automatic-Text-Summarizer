General Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made his
first major commentary Friday on the Pentagon budget battle, warning
against a return to the post- Vietnam and World War II reductions.  He
said, "I have been reminded time and again" this is still a dangerous
world and you'd better be ready to respond if someone challenges your
interests."  Adding that the Soviet Union will remain a superpower
into the next century, he warned, "not to confuse a decline in defense
spending with a decline in the nation's enduring defense needs to deal
with the enduring realities we face."
