Actress Elizabeth Taylor, 58, is listed in stable condition at
St. John's Hospital and Health Center. She was admitted to Daniel
Freeman Marina Hospital on April 8 with a sinus infection and was
later transferred to St. John's because of a persistent fever and
pneumonia.

"She is currently being treated intravenously with antibiotics and
will remain hospitalized," said Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious
disease specialist.

The actress had a nearly fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961. Her health
problems started with back problems after falling from a horse when
she was 13. In 1983, she admitted a 35-year addiction to sleeping
pills and painkillers.
