With the recently adopted 50-year ban on mining and oil drilling in
Antarctica, environmentalists are rejoicing.  However, some think the
pact could backfire.  Without the possibility of some return, many
nations may conclude that Antarctic research isn't worth it.  The
U.S. National Science Foundation says, "We've been living on a tripod
--- geopolitics, future uses of Antarctica and research, now two of
the three legs have been taken away from us."  Although proof of a
nation's interest in Antarctica was their research effort there, many
nations, particularly Soviet Bloc, already find the research cost to
be prohibitive and are cutting back.
