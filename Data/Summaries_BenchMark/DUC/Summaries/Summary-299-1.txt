A United Airlines 737 jetliner has crashed in Colorado.  Twenty
passengers and a crew of five died as the plane nosedived to earth
while traveling from Denver to Colorado Springs.

This is the third crash of a United jet in three years.  In July, 1988
a United DC-10 crashed in Sioux City, Iowa with 110 fatalities, after
an engine broke apart in flight.  In February, 1989, the cargo door on
a United Boeing 747 opened in flight, ripping a hole in the fuselage.
Nine people were killed.

Wind shear is suspected in the latest crash.
