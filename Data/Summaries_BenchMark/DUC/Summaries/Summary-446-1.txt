David Harlow is one of the few volcano seismologists in the world.

He and a team of scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey and from
the Philippines listen to the signs from Mount Pinatubo; it had been
inactive for 600 years.  Pinatubo erupted according to the predictions
by Harlow and the team, blowing ash 75,000 feet into the air and
sending rivers of molten ash down its slope.  The accurate prediction
enabled the evacuation of 84,000 people from the area.  Evacuees
included personnel and dependents from the U.S. Clark Air Force Base.
The base may have to be abandoned.
