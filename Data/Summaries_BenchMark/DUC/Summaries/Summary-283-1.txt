One in eight Latino adults in the LA area have diabetes, a higher
incidence than in any other ethnic group except American Indians.
Nationwide estimates are that more than two million Latinos are
diabetic.  An educational effort is underway in California.

Adult onset diabetes is preventable by diet and exercise, and obesity
is a predisposing factor.  It is believed that Latino immigrants
frequently eat a fast or fatty food diet and exercise less, causing
obesity and, frequently, diabetes, according to the Diabetes
Association, which is sponsoring education programs including
information on prevention, symptoms and complications of the
disease.
