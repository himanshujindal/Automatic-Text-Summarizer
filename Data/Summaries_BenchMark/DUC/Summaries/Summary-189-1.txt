The 1990 hurricane season had more storms than usual but did not
include the devastating storms of years past.  Normal rainfall in the
Sahel signaled the end of a 20-year drought and may have spanned
Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo in 1989.  Dr. William Gray, a professor of
atmospheric science in Colorado, predicts a below average hurricane
season based on below average rainfall in the Sahel and other factors.
This season there were 14 named storms, eight of them hurricanes.  The
most deadly was Diana which killed 96 people in floods and mud slides
in Mexico and caused extensive damage.
