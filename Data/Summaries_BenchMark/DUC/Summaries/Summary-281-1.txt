Californians were asked what would state government be like by 1996 if
two propositions to limit terms of statewide officeholders and state
legislators, on California's November ballot, are passed.  Individuals
felt there would be all new faces and the people would have more
control, politics would not be a profession, expertise would come from
the citizenry, and candidates would be more dependent on the party for
financing and less dependent of the special interests.  On the other
side, individuals felt it would be clear that amateurs can't handle
the complex job, everyone is a lame duck from the beginning,
minorities would lose, and power would go to the executive branch and
bureaucrats.
