Ten months after the Christopher Commission called for the resignation
of Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, he has finally agreed to step
down. His decision was the result of his force's helplessness when
riots broke out after the four officers who beat Rodney King were
acquitted. Gates's departure is overdue. 

Six m nths after the Christopher Commission reported that a
significant minority of the Los Angeles police force "repetitively
misuse force," of the 44 officers identified as the object of six or
more brutality complaints, two had been fired, three had resigned and
11 removed from field duty. 28 remained untouched.
