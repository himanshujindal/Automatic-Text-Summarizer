US investors believe passage of NAFTA will be good for the economy,
reasoning that the US, with its superior industrial productivity and
products, will reap the most economic benefits in a more open trading
environment. A NAFTA rejection would lead to greater protectionism and
inflation and slower world economic growth. Inflation is the biggest
concern because low inflation has kept bond yields low and boosted
shares to record highs. A reverse trend could undermine vulnerable
equity markets. Defeat would be bad for President Clinton, who has
invested political capital in getting NAFTA through Congress. The
outcome of the vote is too close to call.
