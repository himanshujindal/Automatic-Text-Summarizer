John Hatch happened upon a novel idea. His idea was something called
"village banking." This system is a means of investment using small
loans to poor women to finance their own private enterprise, e.g.,
selling produce, crafts, etc. This arrangement allows them to create
savings while paying interest and thereby qualifying for larger
loans. The "village banking" system has grown to nine countries.

Hatch says he created the system in order to channel money to the
poor, primarily the mothers of children who would otherwise starve to
death.

The women have a loan repayment rate of nearly 100 percent.
