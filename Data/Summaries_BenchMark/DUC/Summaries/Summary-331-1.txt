White House Chief of Staff John Sununu resigned Tuesday saying he did
not want to be a "political burden" to President Bush during his 1992
re-election campaign. Bush's son, George, informed Sununu last
Wednesday that he was becoming a liability. The conversation was
reported in the press Tuesday and many political strategists saw the
leak as a public signal to Sununu that he should resign. Bush praised
Sununu saying, "He has taken a lot of hard shots that would have
landed on my chin." House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D- Mo,
said that Bush shouldn't expect a White House shake-up to reverse his
fortunes.
