President Reagan has signed a $3.9 billion drought relief bill on
Thursday.  The annual Agriculture Department survey released hours
later predicted total crop production will be 88% of the 1977 average,
with grain production 31% smaller than the 1987 harvest.  Corn, the
largest and most important American crop, will decline 34% from last
year.  The soybean harvest is expected to be down 23%, with all wheat
production dropping 13%.  The department had already predicted that
food prices would increase about 4% and believes this drought will add
about 1 to 2% more.  Food stockpiles, however, remain high and 50
million farm acres are being kept out of production.
