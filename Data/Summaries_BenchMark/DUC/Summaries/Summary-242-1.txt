On March 25 federal military commanders planned to arrest
nonconformist journalists, writers and officials in Slovenia, the most
liberal of Yugoslavia's six republics, without notifying Slovenia's
civilian leadership. Military units would then crush demonstrations
protesting the arrests. The military council claims dissident
tendencies and articles in the news media are part of a foreign backed
conspiracy to overthrow the country's communist government. The
Slovenian Communist Party presidium, which frequently criticizes the
way the federal government deals with the country's economic and
social problems, and Slovenian police disagree with the conspiracy
claim. The plan was blocked after being reported by Slovenian security
organizations.
