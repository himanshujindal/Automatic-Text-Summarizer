Charles Keating, the Phoenix businessman and savings and loan owner,
may have finally come to a measure of reality. His legal battles
against creditors, regulators and prosecutors looked like a lost
cause. For this reason, he may have considered that flight was the
only means of escape.

Perhaps the presiding judge at Keating's hearing also came to this
realization when he refused to reduce a five million dollar bail for
Keating.  The latter was indicted on 42 counts of state securities
fraud.

The judge, in making his ruling, said that Keating, "has significant
reasons not to stay around."
