The British Office of Fair Trading is investigating whether De Beers'
Central Selling Organization, which controls 80 percent of world
diamond trading, engages in anti- competitive practices. First it has
to establish whether it has jurisdiction, since although CSO is based
in London, De Beers is a South African company. Consolidated Gold
Fields PLC, a British mining concern with no diamond interests, filed
the complaint as a defensive move against a takeover bid by
Luxembourg-based Minorco SA, which is majority-owned by Anglo American
Corp of South Africa Ltd and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd, the gold
and diamond mining interests controlled by South Africa's Oppenheimer
family.
