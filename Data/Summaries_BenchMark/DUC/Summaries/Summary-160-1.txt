Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knocked off track and field's
pedestal after testing positive for steroids now says that it's wrong
to cheat and bad for health.  Johnson said, "I got caught in Seoul.  I
lost my gold medal".  Some US Congressional Representatives are
presenting legislation to make anabolic steroids a controlled
substance similar to the designation given to cocaine and heroin.  The
legislators emphasized increasing abuse of steroids by athletes at all
levels.  Johnson told other athletes not to make the mistake that he
did urging them "to come forward, to come clean."
