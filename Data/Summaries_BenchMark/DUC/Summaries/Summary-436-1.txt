There was a final note of greed and dishonesty displayed by Charles
Keating and his associates a short time after federal regulators
seized the Lincoln Savings and Loan about a year ago.

One veteran regulator described the seizure of the company as the most
bizarre and chaotic situation he had ever encountered. Loan and credit
files, said the regulator, were missing. FDIC personnel managed to
retrieve the files when the savings and loan managers offered the
files in exchange for the art in the company's offices. Keating later
denied that there was any such bartering.
