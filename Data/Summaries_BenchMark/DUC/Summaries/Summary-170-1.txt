A fresh oil sheen has seeped from the ruptured Exxon Valdez making a
complete clean-up impossible.  The vessel is now undergoing temporary
repairs 30 miles from the rupture site. The Alaskan Senate passed
bills to add to state's spill response fund, prevent companies from
deducting spill costs from oil production taxes, develop state
contingency plans, establish a spill response team, and create a
commission to investigate the Exxon Valdez spill.  It is unlikely that
the House would approve the bill before adjournment.
