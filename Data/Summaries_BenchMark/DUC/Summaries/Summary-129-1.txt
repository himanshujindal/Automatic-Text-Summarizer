John Kelley is in training for his 60th Boston Marathon.  The 83-year
old icon of the marathon world is the object of attention for his
endurance.  The 26- mile, 385 yard course will claim many a runner but
Kelley hopes to finish the grinding course as he did last year.

Kelley is a medical wonder and he continues to confound the experts
over his physical condition.

Originally he started running after work 60 years ago in order to
relax and began entering the Boston Marathon.  He won in 1933 and 1945
and was a runner-up seven times.  Experts predict that, even at the
age of 83, he will finish ahead of most of the 13,000 other runners
entered in the race.
