India's 1991 election process was postponed on May 22 when former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a bomb explosion in
Striperumbudur, the capitol of Tamil Nadu.  At least 14 other people,
including a police officer, died in the blast.  In the opinion of some
Indian political leaders, Gandhi's death at age 46 marks the likely
end of the political dynasty that dominated Indian politics since
independence in 1947.  Others denounced the killing and urged the
country to remain calm.  Gandhi's Congress Party has many enemies
including separatists, leftist revolutionaries, and Hindi militants,
but namely hardened opponents in Tamil Nadu.
