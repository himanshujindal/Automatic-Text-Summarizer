The Kansas City police have suffered a string of complaints about
excessive force and racism. Most recently a young stockbroker, was
shot dead by a police officer who entered the victim's apartment at
3:30 a.m. looking for a prowler.  It was the seventh shooting death
involving Kansas City police this year. In June several white officers
bloodied a Nigerian-born Roman Catholic priest with nightsticks as he
lay on the ground. In May another black clergyman was hit on the head
with a shotgun by a white officer as he lay on the ground. Earlier
this year four officers riddled a man brandishing a barbecue fork with
15 bullets, killing him.
