1990 is fast becoming one of the worst years on record for tornadoes
and flooding across the middle and southern sections of the country.
One tornado in Kansas was the strongest since 1985.  Flooding in the
South and the Plains has been as destructive as the tornadoes.
Studies of tornadoes indicate they are concentrated in regions for
five or six year periods.  Parts of the Midwest, particularly Kansas
and Missouri, seem to be entering such a trend.  However, because
computers allow meteorologists to see more sources of data more
clearly, warning of impending storms is becoming more sophisticated
leading to fewer deaths.
