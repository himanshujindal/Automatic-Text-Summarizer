From a helicopter, the Alaskan beach appears untouched by the worst
oil spill in US history but hundreds of gallons of oil are locked up
under the surface.  A year after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, dead
birds no longer wash up onto the beach but thousands were killed
earlier.  Exxon notes that the spill did not wipe out any species and
that surviving animals can rebuild populations.  But the US Fish and
Wildlife Service says that could take 70 years. Joseph Hazelwood is on
trial for drunken driving of the vessel as captain.  Criminal
indictments have been issued against Exxon and they also face more
than 150 civil lawsuits.
