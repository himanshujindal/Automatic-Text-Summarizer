The assassination in late September 1994 of Mr. Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu, the number two official in Mexico's ruling party, probably
removed doubts about the difficulty of reforming the Country's
political and judicial systems.  Mr. Ruiz Massieu's killing was
allegedly ordered by a federal deputy of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) and a former tourism developer with strong
links to a Gulf drug cartel.  This alleged alliance has underlined
concerns that efforts by Mexico's next president, Ernesto Zedillo, to
reform the governing party will be met with fierce and violent
resistance from those who stand to lose from these changes.
