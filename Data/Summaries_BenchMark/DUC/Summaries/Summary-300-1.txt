A French DC-10 jetliner with 171 on board exploded in the air,
possibly from a terrorist bomb, in Niger, Northern Africa.  All aboard
presumably died, including the wife of the American Ambassador to
Chad.

Intelligence specialists in Washington believe the bombing may be in
retaliation against France for its recent Lebanese activities.  France
has been trying to broker a settlement there between Christian and
pro-Syrian forces.

The DC-10 was owned by the French airline UTA and crashed Tuesday,
September 19, after taking off from N'Djamena, Chad.

Anonymous callers claimed responsibility on behalf of the Islamic
Jihad.
