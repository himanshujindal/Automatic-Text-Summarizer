On Friday, The Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined
to press charges against several physicians after looking into
allegations that they over-prescribed painkillers to actress Elizabeth
Taylor.

In a written report, the district attorney's office said the
prescribing practices "fell below the accepted standard of medical
practice," but added the doctors "were also attempting to deal with
her addiction through alternative means of therapy and treatment, and
"devoid of criminal intent."

The report went on to say that one of the physicians repeatedly tried
to persuade Miss Taylor to enter a rehabilitation clinic but she
rejected these efforts until October 1988.
