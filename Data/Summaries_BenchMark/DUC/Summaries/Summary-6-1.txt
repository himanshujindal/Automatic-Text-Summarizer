British government experts reassured the public yesterday that it is
safe to eat beef and that there is no scientific evidence of a causal
link between "mad cow" disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or
BSE) and human Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD). Anxiety had been
raised by news that a dairy farmer whose herd had a case of BSE in
1989 died last year of CJD. Both diseases are caused by particles of
infectious protein called prions. There has been no change in the
incidence of CJD, however, while the incidence of BSE has continued to
grow.
