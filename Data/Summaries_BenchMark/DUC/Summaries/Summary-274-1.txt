William Mellor discusses the constitutionality of term limits.  While
laws baring first-time candidates from running have been invalidated,
state laws limiting tenure of congressional officeholders have not
been tested.  Florida will provide an opinion later in the month.
California's limit on state terms has been upheld.  Term limits do not
restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his ideology and
candidates may be elected to a different office or re-elected to the
same office after a waiting period.  Term limits also do not violate
the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.  The U.S. Supreme
Court has long held that the states have the power to regulate
elections.
