Dr. William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State
University predicted that the 1990 tropical storm season would be
above average.  Rainfall in the Sahel region of West Africa is the
indicator he uses to predict hurricanes.  Winds moving across warm
ocean air cause updrafts of air bearing sea water that turn into rain
clouds.  In the absence of moisture, the storms quickly dissipate, but
storms gather strength with additional moisture.  Comparing yearly
rainfall levels in the Sahel with the number of high-powered Atlantic
hurricanes, Dr Gray found a striking correlation.  Dr Gray said
climate changes in the Sahel result from natural weather cycles.
