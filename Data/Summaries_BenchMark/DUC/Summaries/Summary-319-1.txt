Michael Milken's new company, International Capital Access Group, is
up and running and its founder says it will help members of minority
groups and unions raise the capital to own companies. ICAG has already
purchased $2.5 million of equipment for lease to a company that was
bought out by unionized employees in 1987. Milken says that he has
been approached by several hundred companies and ICAG is doing work
for about 30 of these. However, all is not that rosy. Because he is
under indictment Milken can not trade or underwrite securities and
many potential clients are frightened of having their names publicly
associated with him.
