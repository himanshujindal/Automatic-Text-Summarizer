Charles Keating was indicted on fraud and racketeering charges
following the failure of his savings and loan company. The failure was
the result of systematic looting by Keating, family members and
associates.

Keating et al. apparently loved the good life. To support their high
spending habits, they siphoned-off $975,000 from the savings and loan
for their personal use at the same time as another one of Keating's
companies was preparing for bankruptcy protection.

Nor did they express concern about the manner in which they obtained
funds to support this lifestyle. Many of the investors were retirees
on fixed incomes.
