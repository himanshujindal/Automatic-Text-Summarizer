Senators this week have been busy attempting to prove that Judge
Robert Bork, President Reagan's nominee to the Supreme Court, is a
judicial extremist, a threat to the republic.  They are replaying
anything controversial that he ever wrote or said.  Further, they are
aided by activists who claim Bork does not support the rights of
women, minorities, the press and other groups.  One group, "People for
the American Way" suggests that anyone who supports Bork opposes "the
people."  Senators of the judiciary committee are following these
lobbyists lead in their questioning.  Bork defended himself well, with
scholarly precision and often humor.
