Weeks ago a North American free trade agreement between the US, Canada
and Mexico seemed assured, with support of Republicans and most
congressional Democrats. Now strong opposition comes from presidential
candidate Ross Perot and working class Hispanic Americans who say
NAFTA will cost jobs. White House polls show President Bush's support
for NAFTA is a winning issue. Trade lobbyists think Democrats will use
it as a weapon, citing his 1991 commitment to environmental issues and
labor.  Democratic frontrunner Clinton will likely deem NAFTA the
wrong kind of agreement.  The environment, farm and labor coalition
will not support NAFTA without environment or food safety
provisions.
