   An engine fire broke out early today on a cruise
ship carrying more than 700 people in the Gulf of Mexico, but the
blaze appeared to have been brought under control, according to
officials and a nearby ship's captain.
   No injuries were reported, said Petty Officer Brian Lincoln, of
the U.S. Coast Guard's Miami office.
   The Scandinavian Star was about 35 miles off Isla Mujeres, a
Mexican island north of the tourist resort Cancun in the Yucatan
peninsula, said Coast Guard Lt. Jim Mazzonna in Miami.
   ``All we know is that the ship's captain ... is completely out
of fire-fighting equipment and has requested additional
fire-fighting equipment such as foam, water and CO2,'' said
Lincoln, referring to carbon dioxide.
   Coast Guard cutters, the Canada Star cruise ship and the vessel
Vera Cruz stood by to assist in evacuating passengers, Lincoln said.
   The Canada Star's captain, Jens Thorn, said later that the fire
appeared to have been brought under control, and there was no
reason to evacuate.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Richard Esterline said 707 people,
including crew, were aboard the ship.
   The Scandinavian Star, owned by SeaEscape Ltd., offers daily
``cruises to nowhere'' out of its port in St. Petersburg, records
show.
