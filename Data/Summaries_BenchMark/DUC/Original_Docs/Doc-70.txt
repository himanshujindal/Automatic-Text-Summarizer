   And, a reporter asked, what would she say to Anita Hill if she had the
chance?;   "I'd tell her to pray," she replied. "She needs God bad. I won't
say nothing bad about her because she's a mother-child, too. But, whoever put
her up to it, I just pray she'll get her life straightened out.";   In Thomas'
birthplace, the hometown crowd has made no attempt to disguise where its heart
lies. A handwritten sign on the main thoroughfare announces: "Pinpoint
Georgia, the home of Judge Clarence Thomas.";   Not surprisingly, no one here
seemed to believe Hill's allegation that Thomas had sexually harassed her
between 1981 and 1983 while she worked for him.;   From a roof, a sign
announced: "We believe Clarence.";   Much of the community gathered before the
only big-screen television available, at the home of Abraham Famble, deacon of
the Sweet Fields of Eden Baptist Church, as the time for the Senate vote
neared.;   Williams prayed silently in the kitchen, asking God to watch over
her son as she rubbed her hands nervously. The crowd joined her in the 23rd
Psalm : "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death . . .";   As
the tally reached a majority for Thomas, a cry of joy and applause rang out.; 
 "Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal," Famble said.
