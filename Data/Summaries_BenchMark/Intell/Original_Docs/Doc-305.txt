Endeavour Shuttle To Be Launched To ISS

 



 
 The launch of the US Endeavour shuttle has been planned for 
Wednesday night, December 5, at 01:45 a. m. Moscow time. 
Shuttle's tanks have been filled with fuel. The vehicle is 
currently located at the launch site on the Cape Canaveral, 
Florida. This information was disclosed by a NASA representative 
at the Russian Mission Control.

  According to NASA experts, the primary objective of the 
shuttle's mission is to deliver to the International Space 
Station (ISS) the 4th long-term expedition led by Russian 
cosmonaut Yuri Onufriyenko. The new expedition also includes two 
American astronauts - Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch. This crew 
will replace the 3rd long-term expedition (American astronaut 
Frank Culbertson and two Russian cosmonauts - Vladimir Dezhurov 
and Mikhail Tyurin,) which has been aboard the ISS since August 
13.

  Endeavour will also deliver an Italian Raffaello cargo module 
with additional equipment for the ISS and the Starshine small 
satellite, which will be subsequently launched from the station. 
It will be launched into space for scientific purposes. The 
satellite has been built according to students' design. NASA 
representatives also said that the satellite will be surveyed 
and used by several American universities.
