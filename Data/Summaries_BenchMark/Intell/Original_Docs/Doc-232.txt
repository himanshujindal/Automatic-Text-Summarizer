Supplies of Russian natural gas to 
the Romanian market were discussed during a meeting between 
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller and Romanian Ambassador to Russia

According the release, the sides also discussed gas storage on 
Romanian territory and the setting up of a joint venture in this 
area. Iliye confirmed the interest of the Romanian government in 
developing more dynamic and broader cooperation with Gazprom. He

Nastase to Miller to come to Romania on a working visit. The
