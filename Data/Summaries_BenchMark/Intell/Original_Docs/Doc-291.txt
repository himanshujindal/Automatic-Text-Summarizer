TEHRAN TIMES INTL. DESK

  TEHRAN In a rare move on Tuesday, Israeli Parliament Speaker 
Avraham Burg condemned the Zionist regime's occupation of 
Palestinian territories.

  In an interview with the Qatari Al Jazeera television network, 
Burg denounced the policy, much to the displeasure of Israeli 
officials and right-wing MPs. He repeatedly said that the 
occupation of the Palestinian territories could lead to 
corruption in Israel and would only create scandals for the 
regime.

  Earlier this week some 50 Israeli army officers were reported to 
have been on strike and refused to attack Palestinian ruled 
areas in protest of the occupation policies of the Zionist 
regime. They said fighting for the settlers who had occupied the 
Palestinian lands was by no means a defensive act, and was 
merely part of the criminal policies of Israel.
