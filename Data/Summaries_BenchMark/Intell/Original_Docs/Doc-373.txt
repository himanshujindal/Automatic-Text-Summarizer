More Prisoners Detained in Guantanamo Bay Join Hunger Strike

 






  Strike Triggered by a TurbanAccording to military sources at the 
U.S. base, the hunger striker was first triggered on Wednesday 
when the guard took the turban off the detainee's head while he 
was still praying.

  The sources argued that it was against the rules of the prison 
because the turban could be used to conceal a weapon.

  Bush Criticized for Treating Detainees InhumanelyAs more inmates 
joined the hunger strike, some of them reportedly chanted 
rhythmically on Thursday. Prison officials have reportedly 
strengthened the already heavy security at the prison for 
precautions.

  The Bush administration has been under international criticism 
for not treating the detainees humanely. It recently bowed to 
international pressure to grant the Taliban prisoners the status 
of prisoner of war but still refused to cover al Qaeda prisoners 
with the same treatment.
