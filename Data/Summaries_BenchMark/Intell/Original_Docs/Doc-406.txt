China criticizes US human rights report

 





  BEIJING - China issued its annual report on human rights in the 
United States on Monday, accusing Washington of turning a blind 
eye to abuses in its own land while criticizing other countries 
for theirs.

  The report by the Information Office of the State Council, 
China's Cabinet, listed evidence of police abuses, poverty, 
racial discrimination and lack of personal safety in the United 
States, the official Xinhua news agency said.

  It also accused Washington of "wantonly infringing" on the 
sovereignty of other nations through military operations and 
stationing US forces overseas, Xinhua said.

  The report also slammed US President George W. Bush's 
administration for withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on 
cutting greenhouse gases.

  China releases the report every year in response to a US State 
Department report on global human rights conditions, which 
usually accuses China of widespread abuses. The US report came 
out last week.

  "Once again the United States, assuming the role of `world judge 
of human rights' has distorted human rights conditions in many 
countries and regions in the world, including China, and accused 
them of human rights violations, all the while turning a blind 
eye to its own human rights-related problems," the Chinese 
report said.
