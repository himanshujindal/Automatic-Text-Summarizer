Consumer Reports magazine slapped a "_ Not Acceptable _" label on two sport/utility vehicles Tuesday , saying the light trucks "_ have too great a tendency to roll over in certain situations . _"
The magazine said the 1995 and 1996 models of the Isuzu Trooper , made by Isuzu Motors Ltd. , and the 1996 Acura SLX , also made by Isuzu but sold by Honda Motor Co. Ltd. , were a danger to consumers because they "_ tipped up high on two wheels _" in road tests .
The magazine said consumers should stop buying the models , called for an immediate recall of the approximately 35,000 cars that have been sold and said repairs or replacement models should be offered by the manufacturer .
"_ We do_ n't think a vehicle that has these characteristics should do what it did when subjected to this not inconceivable situation , _" said Bob Knoll , director of testing for Consumer Reports' auto division , in a telephone interview
A spokesman for Isuzu defended the vehicles .
"_ It_ 's very important for both consumers in general and Isuzu Trooper owners to understand very clearly that the Isuzu Trooper meets all federal safety standards and regulations , _" Isuzu spokesman Daniel McCue told Reuters .
But Smith Barney analyst David Garrity said the report by the influential magazine could prove damaging .
"_ If Consumer Reports comes out and says , '_ Do_ n't buy this product , _' the sales will go down , _" Garrity said . "_ You saw what happened to the Suzuki Samurai in the '80s ._"
The tiny Suzuki Samurai , introduced in the mid-1980s , was also the target of a Consumer Reports article alleging that the sport/utility vehicle was prone to rollovers .
The campaign eventually led to the vehicle being pulled off the market .
Garrity said the report was a blow to Honda's Acura brand , which it has worked hard to cultivate .
"_ If I were Honda , I_ 'd demand ( of Isuzu ) that the problem be fixed , and I_ 'd be more focused on developing my own product , _" he said .
Consumer Reports also asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate the Trooper and SLX and called for more stringent government oversight of vehicles with narrow wheelbases .
Government regulations currently call for all vehicles with a wheel base of 110 inches or less to carry a warning sticker stating that "_ sharp turns or abrupt manoeuvres _" may cause the vehicle to roll over or crash .
Both the Trooper and the SLX have wheelbases of 108.7 inches .
Both companies said they were reviewing Consumer Report's test data and would look further into the matter .
Neither McCue nor Acura spokesman Mike Spencer knew of any reports from customers of their vehicles tipping or rolling over , and neither knew of any ongoing NHTSA investigation .
"_ We have not had an opportunity to thoroughly review the testing methodology used .
Nevertheless , Acura believes the SLX is a safe and reliable vehicle when driven in a responsible manner , _" Spencer told Reuters .
According_to Spencer , only about 1,857 SLXs have been sold since the vehicle was introduced in November , 1995 .
