Lower imports shrank the U.S. trade deficit dramatically in June , the Commerce Department said Tuesday , bolstering the impression of gradual waning in the economy's vigour .
The monthly gap between exports and imports plunged 23.1 percent to $8.11 billion from a revised $10.55 billion in May as fewer new foreign-made cars and computers poured into American markets .
New bilateral irritants emerged , though , as the trade shortfall with China swelled 8.8 percent to $3.33 billion to become the biggest with any country .
It surpassed for the first time the $3.24 billion deficit with Japan , which was up 3.6 percent from May .
Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor told a news conference that the Clinton administration was "_ extremely resolute _" about trying to break down Chinese barriers to U.S.-made goods .
While imports of relatively cheap consumer goods from China kept rising , exports to the Asian trade giant fell for a fourth straight month during June to the lowest level since the beginning of 1995 , creating a deficit that Kantor called "_ too high . _"
Analysts were surprised by the sharp 3.3 percent falloff in overall June imports to $77.82 billion , while exports held up relatively well , falling just 0.3 percent to $69.71 billion .
"_ It says that exports are providing some underpinning for the U.S. economy but overall it tells us that we have sharply weakened in terms of economic vigour and activity , _" said Roger Shields , head of country risk management for Chase Manhattan Bank in New York .
Consumer goods exports in June were a record $5.95 billion , up $41 million from May .
That partly offset a $138 million decline to $12.32 billion in foreign sales of industrial supplies and materials .
The United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that reduces the impact of chronic merchandise trade deficits .
In June , the merchandise deficit fell 13.9 percent to $14.46 billion from $16.79 billion in May .
Lower imports of new cars and parts , especially from Japan and Germany , as_well_as cheaper petroleum helped shrink the merchandise trade gap .
The surplus on services climbed 1.6 percent to $6.34 billion from $6.25 billion in May .
Analysts said beforehand that an influx of tourists bound for the Olympic Games in Atlanta would boost the services surplus .
Lawrence Chimerine , executive director of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington , said trade benefited in June as the U.S. economic expansion lost some steam and dampened consumers' ardor for imports .
But he warned that it will be hard to keep exports growing .
"_ The economy is slowing , _" Chimerine said . "_ June marked the start of that process and the weak imports were part of it .
"_ But Europe is bouncing back only slowly , Japan is still wavering and Canada is weak _" as a source of demand for American goods , Chimerine said . "_ I do_ n't think we_ 're going to see a_lot_of progress on lowering the trade deficit for the rest of this year . _"
For the first six months of 1996 , the cumulative goods and services deficit was down 14 percent to $52.62 billion from $61.34 billion in the first half of 1995 .
The cost and volume of all types of petroleum products fell in June after a sharp May runup .
The cost of petroleum imports declined to $5.33 billion in June from $5.93 billion while the volume fell to 291,866 barrels from 305,171 in May .
Foreign sales of civilian aircraft declined in June by $117 million to $1.54 billion .
Exports of industrial supplies and materials were off $138 million to $12.32 billion .
Imports of autos and parts from all sources dropped sharply , by $689 million to $10.79 billion in June .
Computer imports were down $413 million to $4.24 billion and semiconductor imports decreased $291 million to $2.87 billion in June .
In bilateral trade , the deficit with Western Europe fell 7.1 percent to $761 million and the shortfall with Canada was down 2.2 percent to $2.42 billion .
The U.S. deficit with Mexico shrank 6.4 percent to $1.49 billion amid signs the Mexican economy was recovering from a deep recession and grew solidly in the second quarter .
The deficit with oil-producing OPEC countries dropped 26.9 percent in June to $1.40 billion from $1.91 billion in May .
