Russia needs space tourists

 



 

 If you want a holiday in space and have the means to pay for it, 
Russia offers you the trip of a lifetime.

  Yuri Koptev, the director of the Russian Aerospace Agency, 
Rosaviakosmos, confirmed that Russia is looking for space 
tourists to visit the International Space Station (ISS) in 
October. "There is a free place for the flight in October and we 
are looking for someone who would like to take it", he declared.

  At present, citizens from Poland, Japan and the United States 
are being tested by Rosaviakosmos. Russia pioneered space 
tourism in April, 2001, when the Californian millionaire Denis 
Tito was taken to the ISS for a ten-day space trip.

  In April, 28-year-old South African millionaire Mark 
Shuttleworth will visit the station.
