    Russian ship might have missed proper linkup with space station

 




  CAPE CANAVERAL -- (AP) -- A Russian supply ship docked to the 
International Space Station on Wednesday, but may not have 
latched properly into place.

  NASA officials said it was not clear whether the potential 
problem would delay tonight's planned launch of space shuttle 
Endeavour on a station delivery mission.

  The concern is that a loose fit might damage the orbiting 
complex because of the force imparted by a docking shuttle.

  The unmanned Progress ship, carrying more than a ton of food, 
fuel and other supplies, was launched from Kazakstan on Monday. 
It pulled up to the space station right on time, and the linkup 
initially appeared to go well.

  But NASA later said Russian flight controllers outside Moscow 
did not receive the expected indication that the hooks had 
closed and latched.

  The space station's steering system, turned off for the docking, 
remained off an extra three hours to give Russian flight 
controllers time to study the problem. Some laboratory equipment 
and other items were switched off to conserve power.

  Everything was turned back on after Russian engineers determined 
the supply ship was attached securely enough for the steering 
system to operate.

  Russia's Mission Control worked into the night to assess the 
problem.
