Endeavour Shuttle To Return On Monday

 



 
 The Endeavour shuttle is expected to land on the US Cape 
Canaveral launch site, Florida, at 08:55 p. m., Moscow time, the 
Russian Mission Control reported.


  The shuttle will bring back to the Earth its crew, which has 
spent 7 days on-board the International Space Station (ISS,) and 
the 3rd long-term expedition to the ISS, namely, American 
astronaut Frank Culbertson and two Russian cosmonauts Vladimir 
Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin. Back on the Earth, they will report 
about the results they have obtained since August 13.

  The primary objective of the shuttle's mission to the ISS was to 
deliver the 4th ISS crew and research equipment. According to 
the Mission Control, the shuttle's crew has perfectly 
accomplished its mission.

  On its way home, the shuttle launched into space the Starshine 
micro-satellite, which had been designed by students. According 
to the Mission Control, the satellite which is no larger than a 
volley ball, has been made by thousands of students who were 
polishing small pieces of glass subsequently putting them on its 
surface. It slightly resembles of these rotating glass balls 
which are usually used in disco clubs. It is believed that the 
glass will make it possible to see the satellite at night. 
Students of several universities, in their turn, will be 
calculating its speed and its orbit parameters.

  The 4th long-term expedition to the ISS is led by Russian 
cosmonaut Yuri Onufriyenko. There are two US astronauts under 
his command - Carl Waltz and Daniel Bursch. This crew will stay 
on-board the ISS till May 2002.
