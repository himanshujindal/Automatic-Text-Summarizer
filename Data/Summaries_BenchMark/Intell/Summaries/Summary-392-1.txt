Local authorities have expressed dissatisfaction - but not 
surprise - with regard to excerpts about Lebanon in the US State 
Department's annual report on human rights, a copy of which has 
been delivered to the Foreign Ministry.
An official source who described the reaction on Tuesday said 
the criticism was an annual event and emphasized that it was not 
directed at human rights in Lebanon only, but covered several 
other countries in as well.

The source said that the ministry would soon deliver copies of 
the report to the various ministries concerned, especially the 
Interior and Municipalities Ministry, prior to relaying its 
observations to the State Department in Washington.
The report was seen as discrediting Lebanon by portraying the 
country as being undemocratic or uncivilized and abusing human 
rights, the source added.
According to the source, the 
authorities' dissatisfaction with the contents of the report has 
been conveyed to US Ambassador Vincent Battle, who returned from

American envoys posted to Arab countries.
Each year, Lebanon sends an explanation to the State Department 
about the factors outside of the government's control.

The source said the most serious point in the report was an 
observation that the judiciary was subjected to political 
pressure, but referring to it as being "independent in 
principle."
The report's reference to intelligence agents' monitoring the 
activities of opposition politicians and tapping the phones of 
certain government leaders "is a serious matter and harms 
Lebanon's image as a democratic country," the source added.
The report praised the role played by the Lebanese press, describing it as containing daily criticism of the government and its practices.
