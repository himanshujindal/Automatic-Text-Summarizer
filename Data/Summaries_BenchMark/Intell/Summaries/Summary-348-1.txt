China Disapproves Use of 'Axis of Evil' in International Relations
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said Friday that 
China disapproves of the use of such words as the "axis of evil" 
in international relations.

"We disapprove of the use of such words in international 
relations," said Kong, who also made the same comment when 
answering related questions earlier.
China has noticed that U.S. public opinion and general public do 
not agree to the wording of "axis of evil," he said, pointing 
out that the consequences are bound to be serious if the logic 
of the wording is followed.
China always holds that anti-terrorism campaigns should be based 
on irrefutable evidence, and anti-terrorism attacks should not 
be expanded arbitrarily, said Kong.

He stressed that handling state-to-state relations should follow 
the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, the
Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, and the principle that 
all countries should be treated on an equal footing.

This is the 
only manner that is conducive to safeguarding long-term peace 
and stability in the world and related regions.

recentlyon a statement by the U.S. leader describing the
