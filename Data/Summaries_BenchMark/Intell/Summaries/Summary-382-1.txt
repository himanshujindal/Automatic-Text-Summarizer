Representatives from Japan and the United States have finished 
two days of talks Tuesday on climate change in Tokyo.
They discussed ways of co-operating in the science and 
technology fields to prevent global warming.

The meeting was the first between the two countries since 
President George Bush unveiled a new US plan calling for 
voluntary limits on greenhouse gas emissions based on economic 
growth rather than mandatory targets.
At the start of the meeting, the US said it would promote 
research and development into climate change.
Japan says it still intends to ratify the Kyoto protocol.

President Bush caused an international outcry when he rejected 
the 1997 Kyoto protocol on climate change last year, saying it 
hindered US economic growth.
