Tiny debris outside space station halts shuttle launch
CAPE CANAVERAL -- A tiny piece of space debris floating outside 
the International Space Station caused NASA to scrub Thursday 
night's launch of the space shuttle Endeavour.

The space shot might be rescheduled for this evening, but a 
decision won't be made until this morning, a NASA official said 
Thursday.
International Space Station, where three of them will begin a 
six-month stay aboard the orbiting science lab.
On Wednesday, an unmanned Russian supply rocket filled with 
food, clothes, toilet supplies and other items arrived at the 
station but had trouble docking.

Sensors and photos showed that debris about the width of a piece 
of string or wire is preventing a solid fit on the docking, said 
Jim Van Laak, NASA manager of operations and integration for the 
space station.
NASA experts were worried that if the Russian supply vessel were 
not securely docked, it might jar loose and damage the space 
station.

Van Laak said Russian space officials believe the soft bump that 
happens when Endeavour docks at other port on the station would 
not jar the Russian supply ship loose.
But NASA officials want 
further study because they are concerned it might damage the 
locking mechanism for the supply ship.
A bigger question is when to send Russian cosmonauts outside the 
station to fix the problem without messing up the space crew's 
tight work timeline.
