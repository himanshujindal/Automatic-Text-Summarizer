Bush told a news conference that the United States is consulting 
with other countries to decide how "to deal with this flawed 
election."
Bush suspended U.S. entry privileges for Mugabe, his family or 
senior members of his government.

U.S. officials said the administration may freeze assets of 
Zimbabwean officials involved in the alleged rigging of the 
democratic process.
Another possibility is the banning of commercial export licenses 
of defense articles and services.

U.S. Refuses to Recognize Mugabe Government
U.S. President Bush said Wednesday that flaws in Zimbabwe's 
election will prevent the United States from recognizing the 
government's claim that incumbent Robert Mugabe was the winner.

He also denied entry to those who received "significant 
financial benefit" from dealings with Zimbabwean officials who 
carried out Mugabe's policies.
