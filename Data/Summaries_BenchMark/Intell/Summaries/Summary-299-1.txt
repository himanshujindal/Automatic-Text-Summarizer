IMF refuses to help Argentina pay 132 bn USD debt
Argentina was expecting to receive 1.3 billion USD to help the 
state meet its immediate expenses but after an unfavourable 
report submitted by Thomas Reichmann, it was decided that now is 
not "the right moment" to lend any more money.

The IMF has not managed to help Argentina through its current 
crisis - it has a 132 billion dollar debt to foreign banks and 
is in its third successive year of recession.
The government the week imposed a restriction on movement of capitals abroad, limiting the sum to 1,000 USD per person.
