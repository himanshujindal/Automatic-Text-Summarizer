Brazil hopes US will not interfere in greenhouse effect negotiations
Henrique Cardoso said today that he does not believe the United

States will interfere in international negotiations on 
controlling greenhouse gas emissions.
Cardoso also said he 
believes the US is committed to joining other nations in 
fighting the problem and will adopt domestic measures, although 
they have formally renounced the Kyoto Protocol.
Cardoso made his remarks as he sent congress a message calling 
for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by Brazil and committing 
the country to reducing greenhouse emissions by 5.2% by 2012.
